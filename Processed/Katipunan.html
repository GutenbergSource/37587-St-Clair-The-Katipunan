<p class="first">&laquo;Manila, 21st (Aug. &rsquo;96).&mdash;The
Governor General to the Colonial Minister:</p>
<blockquote>
<p class="first"><i>Vast organization of secret societies discovered
with anti-national tendencies.</i></p>
<p><i>Twenty-two persons detained, among them the Gran Oriente (of
Philippine freemasonry) of the Philippines, and others of
importance.</i></p>

<p class="signed">&mdash;<span class="sc">Blanco.</span></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Such was the telegram sent by Gen. Blanco and read by Sr. Castellano
in the Spanish Camara, announcing the discovery of <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb8" href="#pb8" name="pb8">8</a>]</span>the
revolutionary movement headed by the Katipunan, the bastard child of
Filipino freemasonry.</p>
<p>Freemasonry in the Philippines was but a pretext: under this pretext
the <span class="corr" id="xd26e289" title=
"Source: ememies">enemies</span> of Spain, in days of Spanish rule, and
the enemies of the U. S. in these days of American rule, put themselves
into close and secret communion, to earn out plans of revolt.</p>
<p>This <span class="corr" title="Source: filipino">Filipino</span>
masonry cast its net far and wide, and in its meshes were caught many
fish of all classes and conditions; some of them men of money who
<span class="corr" id="xd26e297" title="Source: saught">sought</span>
in masonry what money could easily purchase,&mdash;honors and titles,
grand crosses and medals; others were men whose pockets were more or
less replete, and whose aims were of a great variety of natures; whilst
others were men whose treasuries were more or less empty and who
<span class="corr" id="xd26e300" title="Source: saught">sought</span>
in masonry what they did not care to earn by honest labor&mdash;a
livelihood.</p>
<p>Masonry was imported into the Archipelago, shortly after the Spanish
Revolution, and was, during the first years of its life, confined to
Spaniards; but later on it opened its doors to half-castes and indians.
In 1887 it extended by leaps and bounds; but <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb9" href="#pb9" name="pb9">9</a>]</span>upon the
coming of Gen. Weyler to the Archipelago, as Governor General, in 1888,
it dwindled away almost into nothingness. Gen. Weyler was, and has ever
shown himself, a patriotic Spaniard; and he would not permit the
existence here, under his Governorship, of anything which tended to the
detriment of his country. Well did the masons of the Philippines and
elsewhere know this, and hence the vicious and cruel campaign they
carried on against him both in the Peninsular and Cuba, but more
especially in the U. S. of America.</p>
<p>The Katipunan, the bastard child of filipino masonry, that
ungrateful offspring which was unfaithful even to the mother which
brought it forth, was a society within the bosom of which was
redeveloped the malay instinct which had lain dormant for some three
centuries. This instinct, brutal, savage, intensely ignorant, immoral,
ungodly; an instinct found still among some of the uncivilized tribes
of the mountain fastnesses of Luzon; an instinct once almost blotted
out after many years of most difficult labor and self-sacrifice on the
part of the Religious Orders, once again burst forth in all its
strength. <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb10" href="#pb10" name=
"pb10">10</a>]</span></p>
<p>The indian left to himself, deprived of the curbing influence of the
christian religion, speedily falls back into the condition of depravity
in which Urdaneta and Legazpi found him. The malay instinct, like the
volcano, vomits forth when least expected; the history of the revolt of
the Tagalogs gives overabundant proof of it. Take one by one the many
leading characters in the revolution, and the instinct will be found so
plainly marked, that it is <span class="corr" id="xd26e312" title=
"Source: unmistakeable">unmistakable</span>. Take for instance Marcelo
H. del Pilar, in whose brain was conceived the plot of the Katipunan
farsical-tragedy; Andr&eacute;s Bonifacio, whose duty was the
materializing of the plot; the Lunas, Juan especially, who had some
time previous, in Paris, given an example of how easily the
<i>malay</i> burned through the <i>veneer</i> of civilization to which
the <span class="corr" title="Source: filipino">Filipino</span> indian
is susceptible; and so on, including the Aguinaldos, the Mabinis, the
Agoncillos and even many of those, who in these days boast in public of
their americanist ideas, and in private plot with treacherous zeal to
overthrow the government of those they call their deliverers from
Spanish tyranny. In them all may be traced the strange instinct of the
old time filipino <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb11" href="#pb11"
name="pb11">11</a>]</span>indian. Entering the fold of freemasonry,
they threw off the bridle of religion which restrained them; loosing
respect for Almighty God and for their faith they soon lost respect for
others and for themselves. The result is well known<span class="corr"
title="Source: ,">.</span> History, the history of the last five or six
years, has shown it to us.</p>
<p>It is of this society of <i>notables</i>&mdash;for such is the
meaning of the full title of the Katipunan&mdash;that I wish to say a
few words in the following pages. I have taken as a foundation for my
study, a very concise statement of the whole situation, drawn up by
Capt. Olegario Diaz, Commander of the Guardia Civil Veterana de Manila.
This document being an official statement, is of vital interest in the
study of the birth, life and internal corruption of that diabolical
association which, gigantic though it was, comparatively speaking,
could, by reason of its infantility, have been easily stifled, had it
been dealt with, with a strong hand. I have taken the document as a
base, and by a series of notes in the form of a somewhat more lengthy
appendix, have endeavored to provide my readers with a file of
interesting items of historical value. <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"pb12" href="#pb12" name="pb12">12</a>]</span></p>
<p>This pamphlet is not intended to be a history of the rebellion; I
have endeavored to confine myself to the society which brought about
the revolt, and if at any time I have strayed from the path I laid out
for myself, it has been because there was by the wayside some flower I
wished to pluck to add to the bouquet I herewith present to you.

</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">It is fully proved that freemasonry has been the
principal factor for the development in these islands, not only of
advanced (<a href="#n2">2</a>) and anti-religious ideas, but chiefly
for the foundation of secret societies, possessing a character
especially separatist (<a href="#n3">3</a>). This conviction I have
come to after the examination of a countless number of documents, and
the much correspondence this Corps (<a href="#n4">4</a>) fell in with,
after laborious work and <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb14" href=
"#pb14" name="pb14">14</a>]</span>investigations, in the possession of
several well known filibusters (<a href="#n5">5</a>) who are at the
present time prisoners; these documents and parcels of correspondence
were included in the military suit tried before Colonel D. Francisco
Olive (<a href="#n6">6</a>).</p>
<p>&laquo;Some 20 years ago, there was installed in this country, a
lodge dependent upon the Gr&there4; Or&there4; Espa&ntilde;ol (<a href=
"#n7">7</a>): a lodge which was inoffensive in its beginning because it
was composed of peninsular Spaniards, with the absolute exclusion of
the native element of the <span class="corr" id="xd26e372" title=
"Source: Archipielago">Archipelago</span>. In this form it developed
languidly until the year 1890.</p>
<p>&laquo;During this epoch, the <span class="corr" title=
"Source: filipino">Filipino</span> colony resident in Madrid,
<span class="corr" id="xd26e380" title=
"Source: Hongkong">Hong-Kong</span> and Paris, in the which figured as
exalted separatists Jos&eacute; Rizal (<a href="#n8">8</a>), Marcelo H.
del Pilar (<a href="#n9">9</a>), Graciano Lopez, Mariano Ponce, Eduardo
Lete, Antonio and Juan Luna (<a href="#n10">10</a>), Julio Llorente,
Salvador V. del Rosario, Doroteo Cort&eacute;s (<a href="#n11">11</a>),
Jos&eacute; Baza, Pedro Serrano (<a href="#n12">12</a>), Mois&eacute;s
Salvador, Galicano Apacible and many others, who were in communication
with the seditious elements of Manila, strove hard to <span class=
"corr" id="xd26e399" title="Source: infuence">influence</span> don
Miguel Morayta (<a href="#n13">13</a>), (Grand master of the Oriente
Espa&ntilde;ol), in Madrid, and with whom they sustained close
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb15" href="#pb15" name=
"pb15">15</a>]</span>relations, to the end that the statutes should be
reformed so that the native element might be affiliated, and even more,
that lodges of a character exclusively Tagalog (<a href="#n14">14</a>),
might be created in the Archipelago. Conferences, general gatherings,
and finally compromises of certain magnitude decided in the favor of
the <span class="corr" title="Source: filipinos">Filipinos</span>,
Morayta thus, unconsciously sowing the seed, the fruit of which we are
to-day gathering.</p>
<p>&laquo;D. Alejandro Roji, resident in this capital, Captain of
Engineers, was nominated general delegate to direct the works, and with
ample powers from Morayta, came the native school-teacher Pedro
Serrano, who enjoyed in Manila the confidence and protection of the
said Colonel, assisted by the Flores, lieutenants of Infantry,
Numeriano Adriano, Ambrosio Rianzares, Juan Zulueta, Faustino Villaruel
(<a href="#n15">15</a>), Agustin de la Rosa, Ambrosio Salvador,
Andr&eacute;s Bonifacio <span class="corr" id="xd26e419" title=

Felipe Zamora, Nazario Constantino, Bonifacio Arevalo, Pedro Casimiro,
Dionisio Ferraz, Timoteo Paez and a thousand others, all indians, but
having a career or a comfortable <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb16"
href="#pb16" name="pb16">16</a>]</span>social position; they commenced
a silent and tenacious propaganda which resulted in 180 <span class=
"corr" id="xd26e434" title="Source: tagalog">Tagalog</span> lodges,
extended throughout the territory of Luzon and part of the Bisayas,
being constituted in 5 years. The character of the native (<a href=
"#n19">19</a>), so propitious to all the mysterious and symbolic,
easily accustomed itself to the ridiculous practices of freemasonry:
the initiations (<a href="#n20">20</a>), the proofs (<a href=
"#n21">21</a>), the oaths (<a href="#n22">22</a>), attributes, signs
and pass words, and the pseudonyms, all and everything surrounded by
shade and mystery, appealed to the native and served him as an
educative ladder which prepared his mind for his entry into other
associations of graver transcendencies, according as the initiators and
apostles of filibusterism, Rizal, Pilar, L&oacute;pez, Cort&eacute;s
and Zulueta had forseen, as can be proved by that correspondence which
has come to my hands.</p>
<p>&laquo;In order to direct the organization of the lodges dependant
upon the Gran Oriente Espa&ntilde;ol, there was constituted by Morayta,
a Gran Consejo Regional (<a href="#n23">23</a>) which received its
instructions from him, and which was presided over by Ambrosio Flores
(h&there4; Muza), and formed of Adriano, Villaruel, Flores (A), Mabini,
Paez, Zamora, <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb17" href="#pb17" name=
"pb17">17</a>]</span>Mariano and Salazar. The newspaper <i>La
Solidaridad</i> (<a href="#n24">24</a>) which, in the previous year had
been founded in Barcelona by M. Pilar, as a delegate of the propaganda
of Manila, and the publishing centre of which was later on translated
to Madrid, was declared the official organ of all <span class="corr"
title="Source: filipino">Filipino</span> masonry; and in its
<span class="corr" id="xd26e466" title=
"Source: colaboration">collaboration</span>, all the <span class="corr"
title="Source: filipinos">Filipinos</span> of a medium culture resident
in the capital, took a hand, under the <span class="corr" id="xd26e472"
title="Source: auspicies">auspices</span> and direction of its new
proprietor, the oft-mentioned and ill-starred Morayta.</p>
<p>&laquo;In 1893 the <span lang="es">Gran Oriente Nacional</span>, of
which the Grand Master is Sr. Pantoja, reporter of the highest tribunal
of justice, conceded powers to the lieutenant military councillor Sr.
Lacasa, and the sergeant of Infantry, Jos&eacute; Martin, to carry on
propaganda in these islands among the native element, and in
competition with the other Oriente. The result did not correspond to
the efforts of the propagandists, who only succeeded in creating some
few lodges in the Capital, in Cavite, Cagayan, Iloilo and Negros. How
could it be expected to prosper, when the Gran Oriente Espa&ntilde;ol
had already catechized the masses of the country!</p>
<p>&laquo;It must be declared, although it makes <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb18" href="#pb18" name="pb18">18</a>]</span>one
blush to do so, that many peninsular Spaniards, and among them some
holding important official positions in the country, have contributed
to this propaganda, scandalous, and from all points of view, aimed at
the integrity of the nation (<a href="#n25">25</a>). Only candor can
exculpate them. May the country pardon them.</p>
<p>&laquo;From the first moments, both in the organ of <span class=
"corr" title="Source: filipino">Filipino</span> freemasonry, <i lang=
"es">La Solidaridad</i>, and in the circulars which the Gran Oriente
sent to Spain for the information of the brethren there resident, was
commenced a coarse and shameless campaign against the Monastic Orders
(<a href="#n26">26</a>), and of scoffing and ridicule of religion.
Later on, this campaign acquired a political character, attacking the
government of the metropolis, and the authorities of the archipelago,
demanding liberal reforms for the country, such as representation in
the Cortes, the colonial C&aacute;mara, municipal autonomy, increase of
individual rights etc. etc., Let anyone with half an eye examine
carefully the collections of the cited paper, and he will certainly
meet with something contrary to the national unity, artfully and
modestly hidden. Let him read the almost <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"pb19" href="#pb19" name="pb19">19</a>]</span>countless number of
documents (<a href="#n27">27</a>) pertaining to the Tagalog lodges, and
sent by me to the judge, Se&ntilde;or Olive, which were united to the
charges, and the most incredulous will be convinced that the lodges and
their aids and abettors devoted themselves to something more than the
propaganda of freemasonry. <i>There is not a single one of the chiefs
and organizers of the filibuster organizations up to this time
discovered, who is not a freemason.</i>&raquo;</p>

<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">At the end of the year 1888, Marcelo del Pilar, a
lawyer of Bulac&aacute;n, and a frenetic filibuster, considering
himself in peril of deportation in consequence of juridical proceedings
formed against him in the said province, decided to translate his
residence to Spain, under the shelter of a certain element of the
country (<a href="#n28">28</a>). In those days was created in Manila a
committee of propaganda (<a href="#n29">29</a>) formed by Doroteo
Cort&eacute;s, Ambrosio Rianzares Bautista, Pedro Serrano and Deodato
<span class="corr" id="xd26e524" title=
"Source: Arrellano">Arellano</span>, under the presidency of the first
named, its mission being the gathering from among the better class
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb20" href="#pb20" name=
"pb20">20</a>]</span>and more wealthy element, funds for the
propagation throughout the Archipelago, of all classes of pamphlets and
proclamations written to depreciate and cast slurs upon the Monastic
Orders (<a href="#n30">30</a>), and upon Religion; and likewise for the
<span class="corr" id="xd26e533" title=
"Source: implantion">implantation</span> in the country democratic
doctrines; finally the nomination was agreed to of a delegation which
should depend directly upon the committee recently constituted, and
which should have its residence in Barcelona, its duty being to make
overtures to the public authorities for the concession to the
<span class="corr" id="xd26e536" title=
"Source: Archipielago">Archipelago</span> of greater liberties and of
representation in the Cortes in the first place. And in order to
sustain and defend these ideals together with some few more, the
foundation was authorized of a bi-monthly newspaper.</p>
<p>&laquo;The committee of propaganda fully fulfilled its mission; it
overcame all the wealthy element of Luzon (<a href="#n31">31</a>),
gathered grand quantities, and Marcelo del Pilar set off for the
Peninsular, installing himself <span class="corr" id="xd26e544" title=
"Source: confortably">comfortably</span> in the &laquo;Ciudad
Condal&raquo; <a class="noteref" id="xd26e547src" href="#xd26e547"
name="xd26e547src">2</a> at the expense of his countrymen (<a href=
"#n32">32</a>).</p>
<p>&laquo;In January 1889, he commenced the campaign <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb21" href="#pb21" name="pb21">21</a>]</span>in union
with his companion of the delegation Mariano Ponce. They founded the
paper <i lang="es">La Solidaridad</i> and constituted the
Hispano-Filipino association, into which were drawn a large number of
the native students residing in Barcelona<a class="noteref" id=
"xd26e560src" href="#xd26e560" name="xd26e560src">3</a>. The committee
made great progress in Manila, added to the number of its followers and
collected funds in return for subscriptions to <i lang="es">La
Solidaridad</i> which, day by day, had more readers; it distributed
books, pamphlets and proclamations of the worst class, for which a good
price was collected.</p>
<p>&laquo;The association had increased hand over hand; its aspirations
(<a href="#n33">33</a>) were most radical; and considering its action
limited in Barcelona, it determined to translate its headquarters to
Madrid, where it would have a wider field for its pretensions. About
this same time Serrano, Rizal, Luna, L&oacute;pez etc., were united to
the delegation and they succeeded in implanting <span class="corr" id=
"xd26e582" title="Source: tagalog">Tagalog</span> masonry in their
country (<a href="#n34">34</a>), and from this <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb22" href="#pb22" name="pb22">22</a>]</span>precise
moment, commenced their relations with Morayta.</p>
<p>&laquo;In January 1890 the &laquo;<span lang="es">Asociacion
Hispano-Filipina</span>,&raquo;<a class="noteref" id="xd26e595src"
href="#xd26e595" name="xd26e595src">4</a> the delegation, and the paper
<i>La Solidaridad</i> were installed in Madrid. Morayta accepted the
presidency of the Association and became proprietor of the newspaper
from which such good results were expected, it counting with an
increased output to supply enforced <span class="corr" id="xd26e604"
title="Source: suscriptions">subscriptions</span> among masons and
their <span class="corr" id="xd26e607" title=
"Source: associaties">associates</span> at the rate of a peso a
head.</p>
<p>&laquo;From that moment Morayta was made the idol of the turbulent
indians, who considered him <span class="corr" id="xd26e612" title=
"Source: has">as</span> their redeemer; no one is ignorant of the
labors undertaken by the said personage in Spain, both in the realms of
journalism and around and about the <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb23"
href="#pb23" name="pb23">23</a>]</span>powers that be, on behalf of the
securing representation in the Cortes, the liberty of association
(<a href="#n35">35</a>) and that of the press, municipal autonomy and
even under a hidden guise, of that of the colony; in the memory of all
is preserved the remembrance of the banquet given by the <span class=
"corr" title="Source: filipinos">Filipinos</span> inspired by Morayta,
to Sr. Labra, the autonomist deputy for Cuba, and no one has forgotten
the proposition presented to the Congress by Sr. Junoy, the republican
deputy, also inspired by the Association and the delegation presided
over and protected by Morayta. And who finally, does not feel
indignation upon calling to mind the articles published in <i>La
Solidaridad</i> by the <span class="corr" title=
"Source: filipinos">Filipinos</span> Kalipulako (M. Ponce), Jaena (G.
Lopez), Dimas-Alang (Jos&eacute; Rizal), Eduardo Lete, Taga-Ilog
(Antonio Luna), Juan Totoo (J. Zulueta) and Kupang or Maitalag&aacute;
(M. del Pilar)?</p>
<p>&laquo;What Spaniard is not fired to anger, upon reading the books
and pamphlets written by Rizal, Luna and Lopez and the infinite number
of printed libels which circulate here full of falsities and loathsome
calumnies against the most sacred and venerated, the Fatherland? Have
we forgotten, perhaps, Dr. Blumentritt (<a href="#n36">36</a>) who
repaid our most <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb24" href="#pb24" name=
"pb24">24</a>]</span>generous hospitality by making common cause with
our enemies? Do we not call to mind, peradventure, that all the
filipino colony in Spain and a good portion of that here resident,
sympathised with that ungrateful man, conferring upon him the honor of
<span class="corr" id="xd26e637" title=
"Source: banquetting">banqueting</span> him and extending to him their
congratulations?</p>
<p>&laquo;Fortunately these labors obtained no practical result in the
peninsula (<a href="#n37">37</a>), but they caused the native element
of some amount of culture to <span class="corr" id="xd26e645" title=
"Source: habour">harbor</span> imaginary ills and want of confidence in
the Metropolis, covert discontent with the authorities of the islands
(38), and finally, sowed the seed of aspirations which could never be
realized<a class="noteref" id="xd26e651src" href="#xd26e651" name=
"xd26e651src">5</a>. <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb25" href="#pb25"
name="pb25">25</a>]</span>but a seed which is to-day, unfortunately,
bearing fruit.</p>
<p>&laquo;A casino of recreation known as the Centro Filipino, was also
organized in Madrid: a revolutionary club was the only thing to which
that center could be compared. There Spain was <span class="corr" id=
"xd26e677" title="Source: discused">discussed</span>, <span class=
"corr" id="xd26e680" title="Source: criticised">criticized</span> and
slandered under the shelter of the law of association which prevails in
the Peninsula, and shielded by the hypocrisy and deception so proper of
cowards.</p>
<p>&laquo;Personal rivalries and the want of morality in the
administration of the funds (<a href="#n39">39</a>) remitted from
Manila by the committee of propaganda, gave rise to a grave
disagreement between the two apostles of filipino filibusterism, Rizal
and Pilar; with the former sided the young and impetuous element; with
the latter the mature and thoughtful (<a href="#n40">40</a>). Both
elaborated the same material, but each using a different process; the
one boldly insolent and hostile, the other masked with <span class=
"corr" id="xd26e691" title="Source: hypocricy">hypocrisy</span> and
calm. Both being ambitious, each found the world too small to contain
him. This state of things ceased with the coming of Rizal to these
islands in 1892 (<a href="#n41">41</a>), Pilar remaining the absolute
possessor of the field at Madrid. <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb26"
href="#pb26" name="pb26">26</a>]</span></p>
<p>&laquo;In the meanwhile the committee of propaganda was not
inactive. It created delegations throughout the <span class="corr" id=

their means introduced the <i>La Solidaridad</i> and all kinds of

assembly Rizal made known the motive which had inspired him to call it
together, which was no other than the creation of a secret society to
be known as the &laquo;Liga Filipina&raquo;, founded for the purpose of
fomenting the advancement and culture of the country and the attaining,
later on, of emancipation from Spain (<a href="#n44">44</a>). He read
out a list of provisional regulations drawn up by himself; these
regulations were unanimously approved; a commission formed of Ambrosio
Salvador and Deodato Arellano as president and secretary respectively,
was at once nominated for the studying and development of Rizal&rsquo;s
project, and the reunion was <span class="corr" id="xd26e744" title=

<p>&laquo;The opportune deportation of Rizal (<a href="#n45">45</a>),
Cortes and Salvador, upset the plans of the &laquo;oath bound&raquo;

<p>&laquo;Before continuing, and in order that the facts which follow
may be better understood, I will give some idea of the
&laquo;Liga&raquo; according to the mentioned regulations. <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb29" href="#pb29" name="pb29">29</a>]</span>Its
determined ends (<a href="#n47">47</a>), were the independence of the
islands; its means, the propaganda of advanced political ideas
(<a href="#n48">48</a>), availing themselves of conferences,
books<span class="corr" id="xd26e821" title="Not in source">,</span>
pamphlets and the paper &laquo;La Solidaridad&raquo; which was declared
the official organ of the association; the culture of the country by
means of study, and its material advancement by stimulating the
creation of large enterprises and industries; and, as a final means,
armed rebellion (<a href="#n49">49</a>). The catechised or initiated
<span class="corr" id="xd26e828" title=
"Source: submitied">submitted</span> themselves to a solemn oath before
a human skull, which they afterwards kissed, signing with their own
blood (<a href="#n50">50</a>) a compromising document, after making the
corresponding incision in one of their arms.</p>
<p>&laquo;All those initiated incurred the duty of making propaganda
(<a href="#n51">51</a>) by all means in their power, and of increasing
the number of the associates, of preserving under severest penalties,
the most impenetrable silence on all matters relating to the
&laquo;Liga&raquo; and blind obedience to their superiors. The
association was governed by a Supreme Council with residence in Manila,
and composed of a President, a Treasurer, a Fiscal, a Secretary and
twelve Councillors; for the <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb30" href=
"#pb30" name="pb30">30</a>]</span>Peninsular and Hong-Kong, the
delegations composed of Marcelo del Pilar and Ildefonso Laurel<a class=
"noteref" id="xd26e841src" href="#xd26e841" name=
"xd26e841src">6</a>.</p>
<p>&ldquo;In each province was formed a provincial council with the
same organizations as the Supreme Council, but with only six
councillors, who, in their turn, had under their orders as many popular
councils as there should be pueblos in the province in which the
council should be constituted. The popular councils with analogous
organization to the provincial councils, had jurisdiction within the
<span class="corr" id="xd26e849" title=
"Source: demarkation">demarcation</span> of a pueblo; they depended
directly upon the respective provincial council and the provincial upon
the Supreme.</p>
<p>&ldquo;All the members of the Supreme Council were to constitute in
the capital of Manila a popular council formed of their converts within
the zone of their residences; and all the members had to <span class=
"corr" id="xd26e854" title="Source: recrute">recruit</span> among the
natives of some culture, till the society should be thoroughly
developed. <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb31" href="#pb31" name=
"pb31">31</a>]</span></p>
<p>&ldquo;Each treasurer collected a <i>peso</i> as entrance fee from
the initiated and a medio (half) peso, as a monthly subscription for
each member. With the said funds there was created a central deposit in
the treasury of the Supreme Council, for the covering of the expenses
of the delegations, and the sustainment <span class="corr" id=
"xd26e863" title="Source: af">of</span> the <i>Solidaridad</i>; and it
was agreed that once there should be sufficient capital, great
enterprises, of a nature undetermined, should be undertaken.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The eternal question of money in this class of organizations
(<a href="#n52">52</a>) gave rise to a serious falling out between
Rizal and the <i>Liga</i> (<a href="#n53">53</a>), on which account
their official relations were severed. The subscriptions were badly
collected, and those encharged with the custody and turning in of what
few funds did exist misapplied them (<a href="#n54">54</a>); this was
what brought about the <span class="corr" id="xd26e883" title=
"Source: decadescence">decadence</span> of the league and the cause of
its falling into discredit and disrepute and for its not prospering, in
spite of the fact that among those who aided it with their moral and
metalic aid, but without formal or written compromise (<a href=
"#n55">55</a>), were a number of shameless filibusters, so much the
more repugnant as the brilliant social position they held under
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb32" href="#pb32" name=
"pb32">32</a>]</span>the protection of Spain was elevated. Among many
others may be cited the wealthy proprietors Pedro and Francisco Roxas
<span class="corr" id="xd26e892" title="Source: , (56)">(<a href=
"#n56">56</a>),</span> Mariano Linjap, Telesforo Chuidian, Luis R.
Yangco, Antonio and Juan Luna, Felipe Zamora, Eduardo Litonjua,
Marcelino de los Santos, M&aacute;ximo Paterno (<a href="#n57">57</a>)
and Nazario Constantino (<a href="#n58">58</a>).</p>
<p>&ldquo;Of the members of the Supreme Council, only the following
succeeded in forming popular councils: Estanislao Legaspi who organized
one in Tondo, known as <i>Talang Bakero</i>; Andr&eacute;s Bonifacio,
one in Trozo, known as <i>Mayon</i>; and Francisco Nacpil, one in Santa
Cruz, known as <i>Mactan</i> (<a href="#n59">59</a>). The rest of the
members of the Supreme Council only succeeded in forming the following
fruitless sections: Flores, one in Ermita and Malate; Zulueta in
Binondo; Rianzares in San Nicol&aacute;s; Francisco in Quiapo; Adriano
and Mabini in Sampaloc and Nagtajan, and Salvador in Pandacan.</p>
<p>&ldquo;In the provinces also the <i>Liga</i> enjoyed such slow
progress, that it was not possible to organize to popular councils, but
sections only, and these were organized in the Laguna, by Vicente
Reyes; in Batangas by Felipe Agoncillo (<a href="#n60">60</a>); in
Nueva Ecija, Bentus <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb33" href="#pb33"
name="pb33">33</a>]</span>and Natividad; in Tarlac the notary del
Rosario, and in Bulac&aacute;n, Pampanga and other provinces wealthy
persons of the same. In <span class="corr" id="xd26e929" title=
"Source: fine">time</span>, there was not a <span class="corr" title=
"Source: filipino">Filipino</span> of wealth or career or of medium
social position, who did not pertain to, or aid and abet the
<i>Liga</i>, apart from a few most honorable exceptions (<a href=
"#n61">61</a>) which it pleases me to recognize.</p>
<p>&ldquo;At the commencement of the year 1894 and when the league had
reached the age of one year, the members agreed to the dissolution of
the society, both on account of the discords which continually sprung
up in its bosom, and for the fear of discovery by the authorities which
had already perceived something of the goings on (<a href=
"#n62">62</a>). A grand assembly of the leaders was called together and
it was determined to gather in as many documents as had been drawn up
or circulated, and make a bonfire of them, so that all compromising
indications should be made to disappear. The society became dissolved
but it took a form more hypocritical. The popular councils re-entered
the masonic lodges, and these took up the work of the <i>Liga</i>, a
thing very easy to accomplish, when we remember that there was not a
single member of the society who was not a freemason. <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb34" href="#pb34" name="pb34">34</a>]</span></p>
<p>&ldquo;There remained however, as a living remembrance of the
<i>Liga</i>, a committee formed of the lawyer Numeriano Adriano and
Deodato Arellano (a brother-in-law of Pilar) president and secretary,
who had at their orders some 20 or 30 members from among the most
important of the <span class="corr" id="xd26e956" title=
"Source: difunct">defunct</span> <i>Liga</i> and who were known under
the name of the <i lang="es">compromisarios</i> (<a href=
"#n63">63</a>). These enjoyed no special organization and worked with
almost entire independence. Their mission was the propagation of the
<i lang="es">La Solidaridad</i> and the gathering of funds for the
sustainment of the paper, and of the delegations in the Peninsula and
elsewhere, with which they sustained active political correspondence.
The work was continued with greater cunning by the lodges and by the
<i lang="es">compromisarios</i>; and they succeeded in keeping alive
the spirit of protest in a good part (the most influential) of the
native element till the end of the year 1895.</p>
<p>&laquo;About this time the populous empire of China was defeated by
the Japanese, and the Japanese Empire, having won the laurels of
victory so easily, began to consider the weaving of a net of
preponderance in the Occident. The <span class="corr" title=
"Source: filipinos">Filipinos</span> who followed <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb35" href="#pb35" name="pb35">35</a>]</span>with
interest and satisfaction our contrarieties in Cuba, considered the
occasion <span class="corr" id="xd26e982" title=
"Source: propicious">propitious</span> for the Empire of the Rising Sun
to copy in these islands the conduct of the Americans in the Antilles.
Japan became the fashion in the Archipelago and its inhabitants were
chosen as models of culture (<a href="#n64">64</a>), wealth, of liberty
and strength. They sighed for their protection and assistance, and to
the attaining of it they uselessly directed their efforts. Doroteo
Cort&eacute;s emigrated to Yokohama (<a href="#n65">65</a>), and with
him Ramos, Baza, Espa&ntilde;ol and others, where they established a
separatist committee in correspondence with that of Manila. Marcelo del
Pilar prepared to leave Madrid to join them, but died suddenly in
Barcelona and finally the foolish political schemers dreamed of the
liberation of Rizal (<a href="#n66">66</a>) who had been deported to
Dapitan, in order that he also should follow Cort&eacute;s and the
others. From Manila there departed frequently parties of wealthy
<span class="corr" title="Source: filipinos">Filipinos</span> who went
to Japan under the pretext of making recreative, instructive or
artistic voyages, but in reality to conspire, and it is assured that
they were listened to by some of the official element of that
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb36" href="#pb36" name=
"pb36">36</a>]</span>nation (<a href="#n67">67</a>). The Japanese
corvette <i>Kongo</i> (<a href="#n68">68</a>) arrived in Manila in the
month of May and no one could explain its sudden appearance in the bay;
but on the other hand the officers were mysteriously <span class="corr"

<p>Whilst Rizal, in Manila, was engaged in the organization of the
&ldquo;Liga Filipina&rdquo; into <a id="xd26e1080" name=
"xd26e1080"></a>which only the well-to-do or educated classes could
enter (<a href="#n70">70</a>), an attempt <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"pb38" href="#pb38" name="pb38">38</a>]</span>which, for that time,
failed on account of his immediate deportation, Marcelo H. del Pilar,
from Madrid, in July 1892, advised the creation of another association,
which was to be similar thereto, but which was to include the
agricultural laborers and persons of little or no education and
instruction (<a href="#n71">71</a>), but who directed in the localities
by the caciques and chiefs, were to form an enormous nucleus which
should, at the proper time, give forth the cry of rebellion. He (Pilar)
provided minute instructions concerning the organization and forwarded
a project of regulations.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Deodato Arellano (brother-in-law of Marcelo), Andr&eacute;s
Bonifacio, Ladislao Dina and <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb39" href=
"#pb39" name="pb39">39</a>]</span>Teodoro Plata where those
commissioned to carry into practice the project of Pilar (<a href=
"#n72">72</a>); they discussed the regulations and added to them making
them still more terrifying, agreeing that they should all immediately
proceed with the preparatory works, and they were not interrupted till
the conspiracy was discovered on the 19th of August of this year
(1896). Both the said organizers and the others who composed the first
Supreme Council, belonged to the &laquo;Liga filipina&raquo;.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The organization given to the society was <span class="corr"
id="xd26e1099" title="Source: analogeous">analogous</span> to that
enjoyed by the &laquo;Liga&raquo; (<a href="#n73">73</a>) but amplified
to the extent of anarchism, swearing hatred and destruction to
everything of a character or nature Spanish (<a href="#n74">74</a>),
and sowing the seed of a race-hatred which has developed to a great
extent (<a href="#n75"><span class="corr" id="xd26e1109" title=
"Source: 76">75</span></a>). The Supreme, the Provincial and the
popular Councils, the sections and the delegations ruled this horrible
association. The first governed the whole <span class="corr" id=
"xd26e1112" title="Source: tagalog">Tagalog</span> Katipunan (<a href=
"#n76">76</a>); the second, that corresponding to a pueblo and the
sections were sub-divisions or fractions into which the popular
councils were divided. Those commissioned to form sections were called
delegations, and whilst <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb40" href=
"#pb40" name="pb40">40</a>]</span>they remained unconstituted, they
depended directly upon the Supreme Council. Every associate paid an
entrance fee of a <i>medio peso</i>, and a monthly subscription of a
<i>real</i>. The collections were made by the respective treasurers and
passed into the central treasury of the Supreme Council. The funds so
gathered were utilized for the succor of the brethren in their
afflictions and sicknesses, for the covering the expenses of the works
of propaganda, and for the secret acquisition of fire and other arms
(<a href="#n77">77</a>).</p>
<p>&laquo;As in freemasonry, the initiations (<a href="#n78">78</a>)
were performed with a <span class="corr" id="xd26e1135" title=
"Source: wealh">wealth</span> of the ridiculous, and with unending
<span class="corr" id="xd26e1138" title=
"Source: extravagancies">extravagances</span>; but of such a nature,
that the ignorant indian was fascinated and became converted into a
slave of his oath.</p>
<p>&laquo;The initiated were masked (<a href="#n79">79</a>) as also was
the person to be initiated; before a table was placed a skull and
crossbones, a triangle and two candles; the person about to be
initiated was told that the object of the Katipunan<a class="noteref"
id="xd26e1146src" href="#xd26e1146" name="xd26e1146src">2</a> was the
liberating of the <span class="corr" id="xd26e1152" title=
"Source: tagalog">Tagalog</span> people, and the expulsion of the
Spaniards from the archipelago, or their <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"pb41" href="#pb41" name="pb41">41</a>]</span>destruction (<a href=
"#n80">80</a>); following this, came a series of questions and replies
in the which the martyrdom of Gomez, Burgos and Zamora (<a href=
"#n81">81</a>), native priests judged and condemned for their part in
the rebellion of Cavite in 1872 was exalted, and they passed on to the
proofs (<a href="#n82">82</a>) which consisted in imitating an
assassination, a suicide, etc. This was followed by the taking of an
oath of striving to effect the liberation of the people till death, an
oath which demanded a blind obedience to the commands of the superior
and the preservation of the secrets of the association under the pain
of death (<a href="#n83">83</a>). Finally, to terminate the ceremony,
they made with a dagger especially adapted to that use, an incision in
the arm of the person initiated and with the blood which flowed from
the wound thus made, the new <i>katipunero</i> signed his compromise
(see note <a href="#n50">50</a>.)</p>
<p>&laquo;The initiated were called <i>brethren</i> and had their
&laquo;sacred words&raquo; and their special signs of recognition. They
were ruled by a code which established punishments ranging from
whipping till death (<a href="#n84">84</a>) and received no orders from
anyone, or had no intercourse with anyone, except with their immediate
superiors. The details which might be made <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb42" href="#pb42" name="pb42">42</a>]</span>mention
of are infinite and curious, but it would make this short memorial
unending to speak of them all.</p>
<p>&ldquo;All the matters of importance and organization were dealt
with in assemblies (<a href="#n85">85</a>) constituted by the Supreme
Councils and all the presidents of the provincial and popular councils.
The accords were taken and discussions decided by a nominal votation
and at least by a majority of votes.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Both the Supreme, the provincial and the popular Councils and
the sections held their periodical sessions in the which were discussed
a thousand different affairs, and the decisions of the Councils had to
be submitted to the approval of the immediate superior. The gatherings
were always held in different houses and localities, no day being set
aside as fixed, but the days of festivities or those upon which was
observed some ecclesiastical feast were chosen for that purpose
(<a href="#n86">86</a>), under the pretext of banquets or dances in
<a id="xd26e1199" name="xd26e1199"></a>which the authorities had no
suspicion, and because on the said days these semi-public rejoicings
were permitted without the necessity of seeking the license of the
governing authorities.</p>
<p>&laquo;Both the provincial and the popular <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb43" href="#pb43" name="pb43">43</a>]</span>councils
and the sections were known by special names; the initiated were
&ldquo;baptized&rdquo; with symbolic <span class="corr" id="xd26e1206"
title="Source: apellations">appellations</span>; and the documents were
drawn up in the Tagalog dialect, the most important being in secret
code.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The first Supreme Council was constituted on the 15th of July

Binondo, Trozo, Sta. Cruz, Nagtajan, Sampaloc, Quiapo, Dilao (Paco) and
Intramuros. Commissioners set out with all rapidity to the neighboring
pueblos and provinces, and in a few weeks councils were in working
order in Caloocan, Malabon, Mandaloyan, San Juan del Monte, Pandacan,
Sta. Ana, and Pasay. In the Capital of Cavite was constituted a popular
council, and sections in Noveleta, Cavite Viejo and Imus. The same
occurred in San Isidro, Gapan and several other pueblos of these
provinces. <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb44" href="#pb44" name=

"Source: &lsquo;">&ldquo;</span>Andr&eacute;s Bonifacio, Secretary of
the Supreme Council, displayed a notable audacity and energy, and this
united to a clear intelligence, gave him a great predominance over his
companions. This predominance he asserted, and in 1893 brought about
the destitution from the presidency, of Deodato Arellano, Rom&aacute;n
Baza (<a href="#n87">87</a>), chief clerk of the Comandancia General de
Marina being elevated to that office. On account of the want of
character and initiative on the part of the new president, Bonifacio
decided, by a <i lang="fr">coup-d&rsquo;&eacute;tat</i> if we may so
call it, to depose him also, putting himself in that office and
becoming the &laquo;dictator&raquo; of the Katipunan.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Under the Presidency of Bonifacio, the society commenced an
era of febrile activity; the greater number of the <i lang=
"es"><span class="corr" id="xd26e1260" title=
"Source: tribunal s">tribunales</span></i> of the pueblos were
converted into centres of propaganda, which were directed by the
municipalities. Pamphlets and proclamations against the friars and the
whole Spanish element were circulated in profusion (<a href=
"#n88">88</a>). Injuries and outrages were invented, and by these and a
thousand and one other infamous means, little by little, hatred and
revenge were inculcated into the mind of the indian. <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb45" href="#pb45" name="pb45">45</a>]</span></p>
<p>&ldquo;In 1895 Bonifacio took the first decisive steps towards the
organizing of an armed rebellion; he sent different delegations to
Dapitan to <span class="corr" id="xd26e1269" title=
"Source: eonfer">confer</span> with Rizal and receive his advice and
instruction (<a href="#n89">89</a>)<span class="corr" id="xd26e1275"

<span class="corr" id="xd26e1278" title=
"Source: Goverment">Government</span> (<a href="#n90">90</a>), but did
not succeed therein. But with his immense <span class="corr" id=
"xd26e1285" title="Source: ascendency">ascendancy</span> over the
popular masses, an ascendancy beyond imagination, he declared himself
dictator. The secret aiders of the Katipunan who pertained to the upper
classes, offered funds of considerable amount, with the which were
acquired a good number of arms which were landed on the coast of Cavite
and Batangas with the aid of wealthy persons (<a href=
"#n91">91</a>).</p>
<p>&laquo;In August of this year (1896) exaltation among the masses
reached its full height, and Bonifacio realizing the fact, prepared
what was necessary in order that in a short time, the conspiracy which
was to take effect on the same day and hour in almost all Luzon, should
be in readiness. The plan of the attack and taking of Manila was
coarsely conceived but it might have been <span class="corr" id=

sacking and pillage would have crowned the iniquitous work.

Adding to this number those of the remainder of Luzon, the total will
ascend to an enormous mass of &ldquo;illusioned&rdquo; who bowed in
obedience to an inquisitous schemer. It must be recognized, however,
that Bonifacio is not a common man; of active character, energetic and
bold, gifted with a facility of expression in his language which
suggested itself to his countrymen; of a criterion clear but badly
cultivated by the reading of books of an elevated style and a
pernicious character<a class="noteref" id="xd26e1459src" href=
"#xd26e1459" name="xd26e1459src">5</a> and possessed of an unfathomable
ambition&mdash;such was the warehouse porter who had charge of the
store house of the foreign commercial house of Fressel <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb49" href="#pb49" name="pb49">49</a>]</span>and Co.
in Calle Nueva, Binondo<a class="noteref" id="xd26e1475src" href=
"#xd26e1475" name="xd26e1475src">6</a>.</p>
<p>&ldquo;His proclamations, pamphlets, and circulars although not a
model of literature were possessed of a certain amount of culture.</p>
<p>&ldquo;In Calle Clavel, in the dwelling house of Alejandro Santiago,
the Katipunan possessed a secret printing establishment, in <a id=
"xd26e1485" name="xd26e1485"></a>which were prepared many most
injurious and insulting publications. There also was edited and
published the paper <i>Kalayaan</i> (Liberty) (<a href="#n93">93</a>)
which only twice saw the light and which was supposed to have been
printed in Yokohama, (it bearing the name of that town as the place of
publication) and was published over the signature of Marcelo H. del
Pilar. This was <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb50" href="#pb50" name=
"pb50">50</a>]</span>all false, all studied out for the purpose of
throwing dust in the eyes of the local authorities. The paper was
edited by Bonifacio, his brother-in-law Teodoro Plata and the secretary
of the Supreme Council, Emilio Jacinto, a young student of law, of no
scanty intelligence.</p>
<p>&ldquo;On the 19th of August last (1896) the conspiracy was
denounced and a great number of imprisonments were made by this Corps.
Bonifacio and those more closely connected with him in his schemes,
fled aghast to the neighboring pueblo of Caloocan and there remained
hidden in the house of the <i>Capitan Municipal</i> (a native) and in
that of the <i>Capit&aacute;n Pasado</i> (also a native) Adriano de J,
father-in-law to Andr&eacute;s Bonifacio. On the 23rd Bonifacio set out
for the barrio of <span class="corr" id="xd26e1503" title=
"Source: Balintanac">Balintauac</span>, followed by some 200
inhabitants of Caloocan; on the 24th they were combatted by the Civil
Guard in the fields of the said pueblo and fled to their former hiding
place.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The Supreme Council convoked a large assembly to be held on
the following day in the said barrio, to which gathered more than 500
members; there a discussion took place concerning the steps which would
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb51" href="#pb51" name=
"pb51">51</a>]</span>have to be taken in view of the failure of the
conspiracy, and of the imprisonments which were being made. Some,
feeling repentant, desired to return to a legal status, submitting to
the Spanish authority but the president Bonifacio protested, proposing
immediate rebellion. Both propositions were put to the vote, and as a
result, that of the president gained by an immense majority; so much
for the prestige of Andr&eacute;s Bonifacio! (<a href=
"#n94">94</a>).</p>
<p>&ldquo;The orders were circulated with rapidity throughout Manila,
Cavite, Nueva Ecija and other provinces, commanding that armed
rebellion should commence at day-break of Sunday the 30th. The day and
hour assigned finally arrived, and the whole province of Manila broke
out; the rebels committing a thousand and one abuses and crimes upon as
many Europeans and loyal natives as were encountered. Like wild beasts
they attacked the waterworks and the powder station situated at San
Juan del Monte from whence they were <span class="corr" id="xd26e1515"
title="Source: valiently">valiantly</span> driven back by a section of
artillery and another of the 70th <span class="corr" id="xd26e1518"
title="Source: regimeut">regiment</span>. Simultaneously they attempted
to invade the suburb of Sampaloc by way of Santa Mesa and <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb52" href="#pb52" name="pb52">52</a>]</span>there
also they were combatted and dispersed by 60 Veteran Guards who
prevented, by their defence, a day of mourning for the city of Manila.
All Cavite, except the capital, arose in insurrection on the afternoon
of the 31st., assassinating and disarming the whole of the Civil Guard
of the province, after an heroic defence on the part of the latter.
They assaulted the convents and estates of the Religious Orders and
murdered the defenseless ministers of the Lord (<a href="#n95">95</a>).
On the 3rd of September the capital of Nueva Ecija was attacked by
large masses of rebels, and the colony<a class="noteref" id=

<p class="first">&ldquo;Teodoro Pati&ntilde;o. A name which all
Spaniards should pronounce with pleasure, because, by his repentance,
inspired by divine Providence (<a href="#n96">96</a>), Spain was saved
from an unending series of bitter experiences.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Pati&ntilde;o, a workman in the printing establishment of the
<i lang="es">Diario de Manila</i>, pertained to the Katipunan of Tondo,
as did also the majority of the compositors and book binders of the
said establishment.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Repentant and fearful of the increase of the association, and
of the criminal projects it pursued, he decided to denounce it to his
sister, a student of the College of Looban, directed by the learned and
virtuous Sisters of Mercy (<a href="#n97">97</a>). His sister made
known the <span class="corr" id="xd26e1555" title=
"Source: denounciation">denunciation</span> to her Superior who called
Pati&ntilde;o into her presence; and realizing the gravity which
surrounded the matter, sent him to the Rev. P. Mariano Gil, parish
priest of Tondo (<a href="#n98">98</a>), a suburb of Manila; to this
Rev. Father, <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb54" href="#pb54" name=
"pb54">54</a>]</span>Pati&ntilde;o repeated all that he had manifested,
and all that he could know, he being only a simple initiated member. He
affirmed that in the printing establishment of the <i lang=
"es">Diario</i> receipts and proclamations were printed, and daggers
were secretly made for the Katipunan, and he offered, moreover, to make
known where the lithographic stones used for the printing were
hidden.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Srs. Grund and Cort&eacute;s, lieutenants of the sub-division
of the <i>Veterana</i> of that district, were called to the convent by
P. Gil, who expounded to them all that had occurred. These officers
made known the facts to their chiefs, and constituted themselves into a
&ldquo;cuartelillo&rdquo;. That same night there fell into the power of
P. Gil the lithographic stones, some receipts and printed regulations
of the Katipunan: objects which were placed at the disposition of this
Corps. In the &ldquo;cuartelillo&rdquo; Pati&ntilde;o was minutely
examined, and immediate proceedings were commenced for the arrest of 22
oath bound katipuneros, whose houses were also searched. In this search
an abundance of documents and effects which justified the denunciation
were encountered. From that time no stone was left unturned
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb55" href="#pb55" name=
"pb55">55</a>]</span>by the officers and guards of this Corps, who for
15 days worked unceasingly and untiringly that their labor might be
crowned with the greatest success.</p>
<p>&ldquo;More than 500 prisoners of importance, among those who were
convicted and among those who confessed, were handed over to the Courts
of Justice together with all the documents, books,
pamphlets<span class="corr" id="xd26e1575" title=

Supreme Council. The back of the vast conspiracy was broken; some of
the guilty have already expiated their crimes (<a href="#n99">99</a>),
many have suffered deportation, (<a href="#n100">100</a>) whilst no few
still remain in prison awaiting the decision of human justice.</p>
<p>&ldquo;If with our aid we have contributed to the salvation of this
portion of Spanish territory, what better recompense and reward for
this Section of the Guardia Civil Veterana?</p>

union of such notable folk: &ldquo;<i>A reunion of people who meet to

Some spell it with C whilst the majority use K. As to the derivation:
the root word is undoubtedly <i lang="tl">Tipon</i> which, prefixed
with the particle <i lang="tl">ca</i> and terminated with <i lang=

<p id="n2"><span class="sc">Note 2.</span> In that period of time in
which the evil effects of freemasonry began to tell upon the public and
private life of the government officials and upon the morals of the
people in general, the Civil Governor of Manila, D. Justo Martin Lunas
(1886), gave a ball to which the cream of Manila society was invited.
Among the selections for the evening was an extravagant item, nothing
more or less than &hellip; a <i>can-can</i>! This in itself was enough;
but what made the matter so much the worse was that the governor had
invited the venerable Archbishop of Manila to the ball. The news of the
innovation spread far and wide, and very soon the whole city was in a
state of wild excitement. In the defense of public morals the
Archbishop deemed it necessary to issue a pastoral letter condemning
such spectacles.</p>
<p>Although not directed at that particular &ldquo;school of
scandal&rdquo;, this pastoral was interpreted by all those concerned,
as well as by the public in general, as a severe <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb60" href="#pb60" name="pb60">60</a>]</span>lesson
for Sr. Lunas and those who had gathered in the government house to
dance the can-can or to take pleasure therein. Hence Sr. Luna and his
party considered themselves<a id="xd26e1632" name="xd26e1632"></a>
offended, and did not hesitate to take <span class="corr" id=
"xd26e1634" title="Source: vevenge">revenge</span> when an opportunity
occurred, upon the aged and infirm Archbishop who did all he had done,
in defense of the morals of his flock.</p>
<p>From this event sprung the seed which gave rise, later on, to the
famous, or rather <i>infamous</i> manifestation of &rsquo;88: an
insensate campaign inspired against the Religious Orders by these
offended ones and their followers (See note <a href="#n30">30</a>).</p>
<p>The Civil Governor at that time was D. Jos&eacute; Centeno y
Garc&iacute;a an active propagator of freemasonry, holding the 33rd
degree. He, together with Sr. Quiroja, fostered and godfathered the
&ldquo;manifestation&rdquo;. In this semi-official insult to Archbishop
Payo, an insult so ably analysed by Sr. Retana<a class="noteref" id=

manifestation, fostered by a governor who drew down upon himself the
righteous ire of all honorable men and women by reason of his
protection of the houses of ill-fame in and about the city, was a truly
masonic invention by which many, in fact some 98% of those who signed
it, were grossly deceived. The following notes taken from the analysis
of Sr. Retana, will give an idea of the real value of the
&ldquo;manifestation&rdquo; and the part the <i>people</i> had therein.
In the Suburb of Sta. Cruz there were 144 people who signed the
document, that is to say there were 144 names. Of these no less than 56
were <i>unknown</i><span class="corr" id="xd26e1659" title=
"Not in source">,</span> 3 were minors and 3 did not recognize their
signatures; 52 were natives and 8 were <span class="corr" id=
"xd26e1662" title="Source: chinese">Chinese</span> half-castes. In
Sampaloc: 61 signatures, all of which were of indians none of whom
followed trades or professions which necessitated the use of brain
power. In Malate: 38 signatures<span class="corr" id="xd26e1666" title=
"Not in source">,</span> 31 of indians<span class="corr" id="xd26e1669"
title="Not in source">,</span> only 15 of whom understood Spanish. In
Binondo: 41, 31 of whom were indians; five minors. In Sta. Ana, out of
104, the <span class="corr" id="xd26e1672" title=
"Source: mumber">number</span> of minors was 14, and 50 did not
understand Spanish; 66 were indians. In Caloocan: <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb62" href="#pb62" name="pb62">62</a>]</span>80
signatures of which 55 were indians who did not understand Spanish; 38
were laborers, 7 were minors. In Navotas: 140 signatures; 49 laborers,
and 49 fishermen; 127 did not understand Spanish. In Mariquina: 68, 38
of whom were laborers, 51 did not understand Spanish. In San Fernando
de Dilao (Paco): 35; 6 minors and all indians. In San Mateo, 50
signatures<span class="corr" id="xd26e1677" title="Source: :">;</span>
39 laborers<span class="corr" id="xd26e1680" title="Source: .">,</span>
45 indians, 41 of whom did not understand Spanish. In San Miguel 49;
and here comes the crowning piece of the magnificent work, for of these
49 no fewer than 16 had <i>died!</i> yes <i>died</i> previous to the
drawing up of the document and therefore could not possibly have signed
it; moreover 7 did not recognize their signatures, and all were
indians.</p>
<p>In recapitulation; there were 810 signatures; of these 85 did not
declare on examination, 56 were unknown, 39 were minors, 22 did not
recognize their signatures and 16 had died previous to the drawing up
of the document (Feb. 20th 1888). This brings the 810 down to 592. Of
these 592 signatures 208 were of laborers, 50 of fishermen, 31 of
carpenters, 7 washermen and 5 barbers: a total of 301 persons whose
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb63" href="#pb63" name=
"pb63">63</a>]</span>occupations called for no particular amount of
education, and whose interest and concern in such a movement as this
may be judged from their social standing. Deducting these 301 from the
remaining 592 we have 291 left for further analysis. Of these 25 were
of tailors, 4 singers (!) and 3 school masters; 58 <i lang=
"es">escribientes</i> whose occupation it is to make clean copies of
documents and other manuscript, the most that can be said of the
majority of them being that they can write well, not an uncommon thing
anyhow for a filipino; 11 of musicians, men who lead the life of
crickets, enjoying hunger by day and noise by night; 9 type-setters,
men who after having set a dozen columns of material could not tell you
anything of the subject they were composing, in other words, men who
like the <i lang="es">escribientes</i> reproduce mechanically without
knowing what they are reproducing; this gives us 107 of another grade
leaving 184 to be divided among the many odds and ends of occupations
followed by the native to earn his &ldquo;fish and rice&rdquo;. No less
than 384 of the number did not understand Spanish and 13 could not
write. In the matter of races: ONE was a Spaniard, Enrique Rodriguez
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb64" href="#pb64" name=
"pb64">64</a>]</span>de los Palacios who called himself a merchant and
was domiciled in Binondo. Upon investigation it turned out that he also
had been fooled and that he had signed the protest because he had been
told that other Spaniards had also signed it; as to its contents he
affirmed that he knew nothing. One was a Spanish mestizo, 66 were
Chinese half-castes and 524 were indians. So much for the famous
manifestation which resulted in giving a most decisive blow to the
moral and social standing of those who prepared and those who signed
it. Those concerned therein learned the bitter lesson that <span class=
"corr" id="xd26e1702" title="Source: &rdquo;">&ldquo;</span>they who
dig pits for their neighbors are apt to fall therein
themselves.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The common opinion has always been that the document in question was
drawn up by Doroteo Cort&eacute;s (see note 11) who had on several
occasions been under police vigilance; had been expelled from Navotas
and compelled to reside within the walled city, later on pardoned, but
still kept under police surveillance. But however that may be, the
document was infamous in the extreme, and was the precursor of the
modern campaign against the <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb65" href=
"#pb65" name="pb65">65</a>]</span>Religious Orders. From that time to
this present, this campaign has continued to spread, and <span class=
"corr" id="xd26e1709" title="Source: in">is</span> still being fostered
by the Federal Party.</p>
<p>Another of the advanced ideas which saw the light of day during the
interim governorship of D. Jos&eacute; Centeno y Garcia, a 33rd degree
freemason and a stout republican, was the toleration, for the first
time in the history of the Archipelago, of houses of prostitution.
Centeno was a governor who, having erred considerably during his
governorship, attempted some years later to regain public confidence by
the publication of an insulting pamphlet against the Religious Orders.
This novelty of semi-official houses of ill-fame was, for Manila, a
most genuine expression of modern democracy. Scandals until then
unheard of or undreamed of in Manila, became the order of the day.
White girls imported or <span class="corr" id="xd26e1714" title=
"Source: enveigled">inveigled</span>, were hired out by their
mistresses to pander to the sensual appetites of blacks, merely because
the said black-skinned sensualists were wealthy enough to pay the price
demanded. What edification! Fundicion street became a centre in which
the scandals daily increased in number and importance. <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb66" href="#pb66" name="pb66">66</a>]</span>The
native weaned after many long years of careful training at the hands of
the Religious Orders, from the vices in which he was found submerged at
the time of the Spanish Conquest, was brought face to face with the
same scandalous surroundings, introduced by people of the same white
race which had removed his forefathers therefrom. Gradually but surely
this leaven of corruption has eaten its way into the customs of the
people, and to-day we are witnesses of its terrible effects. A
comparison of the public morals of to-day <a id="xd26e1719" name=
"xd26e1719"></a>with those of 20 years or so ago, would reveal facts
which would astound many of those who are at a loss to account for the
reason of the existence of the &ldquo;<span lang=
"es">querida</span>&rdquo; evil among so many of the <span class="corr"
title="Source: filipinos">Filipinos</span> of modern Manila. A quarter
of a century ago Manila was a paradise to what it is to-day, crimes so
common in these days that they are scarcely worth recording, were
unheard of; and even <span class="corr" id="xd26e1728" title=
"Source: drunkeness">drunkenness</span> was almost entirely confined to
foreign sailors. What Manila is to-day it owes to the advanced and anti
religious ideas introduced by freemasonry and modern democracy.

<p id="n3"><span class="sc">Note 3.</span> Separatism, <span class=
"corr" id="xd26e1736" title="Source: vulgarilly">vulgarly</span> called
filibusterism, has always, in the Philippines, been marked by
<span class="corr" id="xd26e1739" title=
"Source: essencial">essential</span> characteristics. It was always,
under the circumstances by which it was surrounded, necessarily
anti-patriotic. One thing which helped to give it the robust life it
enjoyed among the middle class of people, was the supposition of the
existence of a <span class="corr" id="xd26e1742" title=
"Source: tagalog">Tagalog</span> civilization anterior to the discovery
of the archipelago by the famous Magallanes. This fantastic doctrine
was preached and propagated principally by two of the more prominent
<span class="corr" title="Source: filipinos">Filipinos</span>, Pedro
Paterno and Jos&eacute; Rizal. The former, much less cultured than
Rizal, was the one to whom the most insensate ideas on this subject
were owing, and this because although Rizal upheld the idea, he was led
to do so by his perverse character rather than by his belief; whilst
Paterno really believes in this pre-Spanish civilization<span class=
"corr" id="xd26e1748" title="Source: .">,</span> and that to such a
degree that many of his own country-men call him a fool and ridicule
him. Another essential mark was the enmity <span class="corr" id=
"xd26e1752" title="Source: demostrated">demonstrated</span> against the
Religious Orders. But few, if any at all of the propagators of the
doctrines of separatism labored outside of the <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb68" href="#pb68" name="pb68">68</a>]</span>four
walls of the masonic lodge room. In other words they were freemasons.
Masonry was to them a medium through which they might carry on their
conspiracies; it was an excuse for the creation of the spirit of
association, till then unknown in the Philippines.</p>
<p>The aims of separatism may be <span class="corr" id="xd26e1760"
title="Source: clased">classed</span> as direct <span class="corr" id=
"xd26e1763" title="Source: and and">and</span> indirect. The indirect
aim was the independence of the country from the yoke of Spain. At the
best this idea of independence was but second hand, a lesson learned by
heart by a scholar whose power of thought was insufficient to enable
him to grasp the true meaning of the words of the lesson. The
<span class="corr" id="xd26e1766" title=
"Source: avarage">average</span> <span class="corr" title=
"Source: filipino">Filipino</span> lacks the sentiment of nationality;
hence in the minds of the majority of the people independence is but
the enjoyment of the unbridled <span class="corr" id="xd26e1772" title=
"Source: liberity">liberty</span> to do as they please, in fact to
revert to the times of their ancestors when everyone who could exert an
authority was a king, a prince or a ruler of some description. To the
<span class="corr" title="Source: filipino">Filipino</span> it is of
little importance whether his <span class="corr" id="xd26e1779" title=
"Source: soverign">sovereign</span> or his supreme ruler be the King of
Spain or the President of the U. S. of America, as long as he is
protected from his &ldquo;friends&rdquo; and from his own country-men
and may enjoy <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb69" href="#pb69" name=
"pb69">69</a>]</span>his cock-fighting and have the necessary supply of
rice and fish for his daily sustenance.</p>
<p>The direct aims of the separatists were those they <span class=
"corr" id="xd26e1786" title="Source: saught">sought</span> in public,
viz: representation in the Spanish Cortes, the expulsion of the
Religious Orders, etc., etc. The result of representation in the Cortes
would have been a veritable comedy; that of the expulsion of the Friars
a decided <span class="corr" id="xd26e1789" title=
"Source: tradgedy">tragedy</span> for Spain, in as much as the
Religious was ever the backbone of the administration of the colony.
The consequences of the independence of the country would have been
equally <span class="corr" id="xd26e1792" title=
"Source: disasterous">disastrous</span>. There would have been the
tremendous preponderance of the black over the white and eventually
<span class="corr" id="xd26e1795" title=
"Source: intertribual">inter-tribal</span> disputes and even armed
struggles for the mastery. This would entail the complete stagnation of
the moral and material progress of the people, who would gradually but
surely drift back into the savage ways of their ancestors. And at last,
who knows but that Japan or perhaps China would have to step in to save
the inhabitants from becoming cannibals.</p>
<p>This doctrine of separatism was the doctrine <span class="corr" id=
"xd26e1800" title="Source: deseminated">disseminated</span> by
<span class="corr" title="Source: filipino">Filipino</span> masonry, a
daughter of Spanish freemasonry. Filipino <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"pb70" href="#pb70" name="pb70">70</a>]</span>freemasonry however, was
to a great extent addicted to views not held or sustained by the
Gr&there4; Or&there4; Espa&ntilde;ol, and hence did not make common
cause with Universal Freemasonry, although it used its ritual, its
signs and its name, to shield from public view those of its labors
which could not be allowed to see the light of day. Hence the diving
into the subject of Universal Freemasonry is somewhat <span class=
"corr" id="xd26e1808" title="Source: irrevelant">irrelevant</span> to
our present study, suffice it to say that the brotherhood, universal as
it is, suffers no other division than that into families. Its aim is
one; its methods one; its doctrine one<a class="noteref" id=

<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb71" href="#pb71" name=
"pb71">71</a>]</span>it is the worldly imitation of the <span class=
"corr" id="xd26e1863" title="Source: unparalled">unparalleled</span>
Catholic unity of divine foundation.</p>
<p>The Spanish family was founded in 1811 <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"pb72" href="#pb72" name="pb72">72</a>]</span>by the Count de
Grasse-Tilley. On the 21st of February 1804 the Supreme Council of
Charleston issued a circular to the Count in which it said among other
things which demonstrate the aim of the foundation: &ldquo;Above the
idea of country is the idea of humanity&rdquo;; &ldquo;frontiers are
capricious <span class="corr" id="xd26e1870" title=
"Source: demarkations">demarcations</span> imposed by the use of
force.&rdquo; And others of the same nature.</p>
<p>When the Count set forth to found the Spanish Supreme Council he was
armed with a letters patent issued by the Supreme Council of Charleston
containing this sentence: &ldquo;the masonic solidity will never be
effective whilst the brethren do not recognize one only power, as is
one only the earth we inhabit<span class="corr" id="xd26e1875" title=
"Source: .">,</span> and one also the horizon we
contemplate&#8202;&hellip;. To unify, therefore, the masonic labors we
all journey to the one end to which the work of this Supreme Council is
directed, and hence what we have pointed out to Spain as one of the
points in which is more <span class="corr" id="xd26e1878" title=
"Source: neces sary">necessary</span> than elsewhere the one direction
to which we refer.&rdquo;</p>
<p>In 1882 Spanish freemasons were divided into different Orientes each
of which claimed continuity with the institution of Grasse-Tilley;
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb73" href="#pb73" name=
"pb73">73</a>]</span>the matter was finally settled by the Supreme
Council of Charleston.</p>
<p>Opinion is divided on the question of the <span class="corr" id=
"xd26e1887" title="Source: responsability">responsibility</span> of the
Spanish freemason lodges or rather the ruling &ldquo;Oriente&rdquo; for
the beliefs and practices of their filipino brethren. That they were
indirectly responsible is more than certain; and oft-times they were so
indirectly. D. Manuel Sastr&oacute;n ex-Deputy to the Spanish Cortes,
ex-Civil Governor of the Philippines, speaking on this subject says:
&ldquo;It is not possible for us on any account to fall in line with
these suspicious reasonings: never have we had a disposition to form a
part of such a sect, because we are old time Christians; but we repeat
that we cannot believe nor do we imagine that any masonic centre
composed of peninsular Spaniards could tolerate, and much less
<span class="corr" id="xd26e1890" title="Source: forment">foment</span>
consciously, the propagation of doctrines which, whatever masonry
brought about in the <span class="corr" id="xd26e1893" title=
"Source: Philipines">Philippines</span>, could have given origin to the
congregation of separatist elements.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Nevertheless side by side with this firm conviction we repeat
what we <span class="corr" id="xd26e1898" title=
"Source: tercely">tersely</span> <span class="corr" id="xd26e1901"
title="Source: ma-maintained">maintained</span>, viz: that freemasonry
has been the medium which marshalled the element <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb74" href="#pb74" name="pb74">74</a>]</span>which
generalled the <span class="corr" title=
"Source: filipino">Filipino</span> insurrection. Filibusterism knew how
to exploit it to a fine point.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="tb">. . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .</p>
<p>&ldquo;We do not find it inconvenient to affirm, but just the
opposite, we repeat with pleasure and absolute belief that Spanish
freemasonry was ignorant of the true ends of the <span class="corr"
title="Source: filipino">Filipino</span> masons. But it is proved to
our way of thinking, to the point of evidence, that <span class="corr"
title="Source: filipino">Filipino</span> masonry <span class="corr" id=
"xd26e1919" title="Source: persued">pursued</span> no other ends than

"noteref" id="xd26e1922src" href="#xd26e1922" name=
"xd26e1922src">3</a></p>
<p>It must be noted that this is the opinion of a Spanish patriot, for
a patriot Sastr&oacute;n certainly was, and what is more natural than
that a true patriot should doubt the possibility of his own countrymen
mixing themselves up in anti-patriotic movements: Yet while
Sastr&oacute;n and other writers would redeem their fellow countrymen
from such a stain as that of treason, I am inclined to believe that the
asserted ignorance of the Spanish freemason was too often
<i>official</i>, that is to say it was not genuine, <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb75" href="#pb75" name="pb75">75</a>]</span>but
limited to the members of the society who enjoyed the privileges of the
lower degrees.</p>
<p>There are two sides to every question<span class="corr" id=
"xd26e1938" title="Source: ;">,</span> however, and that the
&ldquo;other side&rdquo; may be given a fair hearing, I will quote a
declaration of Antonio Luna on this subject. Luna, among the many
statements made before the Lieut<span class="corr" title=
"Source: ,">.</span> Col. in command of the Cuartel de Caballeria, on
the 8th of October 1896, confessed that &ldquo;in the year 1890 or 91,
of his own <span class="corr" id="xd26e1944" title=
"Source: free-wiil">free-will</span>, he formed a masonic project based
on Spanish masonry: a project which might, at its proper time be
applied to filibuster conspiracy. This project was discussed and
approved by the Oriente Espa&ntilde;ol in Madrid; but that center did
not know the <span class="corr" id="xd26e1947" title=
"Source: secondry">secondary</span> ends to which it would be
applied&#8202;&hellip;. Of his own <span class="corr" id="xd26e1950"
title="Source: freewill">free-will</span> he manifested that his ideas
were, when he formed the project,
anti-Spanish&#8202;&hellip;.&rdquo;</p>
<p>With rare exceptions the <span class="corr" title=
"Source: filipinos">Filipinos</span> who left their native soil to
finish their education in the Spanish <span class="corr" id="xd26e1959"
title="Source: peninsular">peninsula</span>, were those to whom the
real work of separatism is owing. The <span class="corr" title=
"Source: filipino">Filipino</span> at home who has fallen into line
with his foreign educated <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb76" href=
"#pb76" name="pb76">76</a>]</span>brother is but a blind worker. And
the <span class="corr" title="Source: filipino">Filipino</span> who
went to Spain was as a rule, a very general rule, taken under the
sheltering care of Miguel Morayta (see note <a href="#n13">13</a>). The
responsibility therefore for the ideas inculcated into the minds of
those &ldquo;students&rdquo; lies, and that heavily, upon Morayta, the
chief of that family of freemasonry which claims ignorance of the aims
of its filipino membership. The only logical excuse that can be brought
forwards is that filipino freemasonry degenerated. When once it took
root in the Archipelago it spread with wonderful rapidity. The adepts
were for the most part <span class="corr" id="xd26e1974" title=
"Source: chinese">Chinese</span> half-castes; and little by little that
strange train of thought of the native, whether he be full blooded or
mixed, a train of thought which, like the filipino pony is accustomed
to walk backwards when it should go forwards, or like the patient
<i>carabao</i> which too often lies down just at the moment when its
services are the most needed to drag a load over a mud hole, carried
the <span class="corr" id="xd26e1980" title=
"Source: would be">would-be</span> citizens of an <span class="corr"
id="xd26e1983" title="Source: independant">independent</span> country
to the verge of political insanity. Certain it is that as the idea of
separation became more and more developed the Spanish masons who were
member <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb77" href="#pb77" name=
"pb77">77</a>]</span>of the <span class="corr" title=
"Source: filipino">Filipino</span> lodges severed their connection
therewith. But yet it does not appear within the limits of common sense
to believe that the Spanish masons were ignorant; the greater
probability is that they were too indulgent, too confiding. To hold too
fast to the excuse of ignorance is to profess oneself very ignorant.
But whether it was ignorance or the wanting of even that species of
<span class="corr" id="xd26e1992" title=
"Source: patriotsm">patriotism</span> which one expects to find in
beasts of burden (for every horse knows his own stables) the black fact
still remains that Spanish masonry gave birth to, and fostered,
<span class="corr" title="Source: filipino">Filipino</span> freemasonry
or in other words, the katipunan.</p>
<p>However, be the degree of ignorance what it may, we cannot overlook
the fact that the actions of the <span class="corr" id="xd26e2000"
title="Source: tagalog">Tagalog</span> freemasons, the katipunan if you
will, for the one and the other are the same thing under different
names, were the cause of no little surprise to the Grand Oriente
Espa&ntilde;ol. The filipino mason was a traitor to the mother which
gave him being and nourished him into activity: a traitor who used the
cover of the freemason lodge only that he might the easier and safer
hatch out his plot to gain, by the most brutal means imaginable,
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb78" href="#pb78" name=

<p>In his declaration made in the presence of Colonel Francisco Olive y
Garcia and others on the 23rd of September 1896, Moises Salvador
Francisco, of Quiapo (Manila) stated that &ldquo;in April 1891 he came
to Manila bringing with him a copy of the agreements arrived at by the
Junta of Madrid, and these he handed over to Timoteo Paez to see if
masonic lodges could be established as a commencement of the work. In
the following year of 1892 Pedro Serrano arrived from Spain and then
Masonry (native) was introduced into the Philippines, the first lodge
instituted being the <i>Nilad</i>.&rdquo;</p>
<p>To give some idea of the separatist aims which gave life and
<span class="corr" id="xd26e2015" title=

a few extracts taken from masonic documents, and from the declarations,
made by persons complicated in the conspiracy. These declarations were
made in the presence of the appointed judge, Col. D. Francisco Olive y
Garcia, and others, and are of capital interest in the study of the
rise and fall of the filipino &ldquo;commune&rdquo;.</p>
<p>The citations are as follows: <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb79"

<p>I. In an act of Session of the <i>Katipunan Sur</i> at the
commencement of the year 1896, the session being opened, the president
don Agustin Tantoko, a native priest<a class="noteref" id=
"xd26e2029src" href="#xd26e2029" name="xd26e2029src">4</a>, invited the
membership present to <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb80" href="#pb80"
name="pb80">80</a>]</span>express its opinion concerning the questions
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb81" href="#pb81" name=
"pb81">81</a>]</span>proposed, viz: how ought we to act towards
society; towards ourselves; and how ought we to act in case of
surprise. Mariano Kalisan considered, dealing with the first question,
that &ldquo;<i>as their principal object was not to leave alive any
Spaniard in all the future <span class="corr" title=
"Source: filipino">Filipino</span> republic</i>&rdquo; they should
procure to make friends with them as much as possible in order to be
able to carry out their plans with more surety when the time should
arrive to give the cry of independence. D. Gabino Tantoko, brother of
the president, considered that the said principle should be carried out
especially in dealing with the members of the Religious Orders. Both
propositions were accepted.</p>
<p>As regards the second question, Epifanio Ramos proposed that
meetings should be held as seldom as possible &ldquo;<i>in order to
avoid scandals</i>&rdquo;.</p>
<p>In case of surprise, Hermenegildo Garc&iacute;a considered that
&ldquo;<i>the strongest fort lay in denial</i>.&rdquo; The brothers
Tantoko remarked that such surprise was almost impossible seeing that
they had determined &ldquo;<i>not to leave alive any of those who might
surprise them</i>.&rdquo; The president moreover remarked that, from
that time forward, in case of <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb82" href=
"#pb82" name="pb82">82</a>]</span>danger, &ldquo;they should destroy
all the papers they held in their power, such as acts, receipts,
letters, plans and especially the arms they held, in case the blow they

second Lieutenant D. Benedicto Nijaga y Polonis, a native <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb84" href="#pb84" name="pb84">84</a>]</span>of
Carbeyeng, province of Samar, stated that the conspiracy was entered
into for the purpose of securing from Spain, by peaceful means, or by
the process of revolution, the independence of the country. He affirmed
moreover that, in the case of revolution, the aid of Japan was to be

was to &ldquo;fall upon Manila&rdquo;, the native infantry sent out to
meet the attack to pass over to the rebel ranks.</p>
<p>IV. In his declaration made in Manila before the same judge, Pio
Valenzuela y Alejandrino stated that he was one of the members of the
<span class="corr" id="xd26e2192" title=
"Source: Inferior">Interior</span> Supreme Council of the Katipunan,
the aim of which was to collect a large amount of money and promote a
general rising in order to declare the independence of the islands
under the protectorate of the Empire of Japan<a id="xd26e2195" name=
"xd26e2195"></a>. Further on he stated that the rising was to have
taken place at 7 o&rsquo;clock p. m. on the 29th of August, entry being
made into Manila and its suburbs, the rebels &ldquo;killing the
Spaniards, and the natives and <span class="corr" id="xd26e2197" title=

<p>V. Romualdo de J., sculptor of <span class="corr" id="xd26e2207"
title="Source: ta.">Sta.</span> Cruz, Manila, declared that he had
founded the Katipunan in 1888, the year in which the manifestation
against the Archbishop was made; he defined the aim of the society to
be &ldquo;<i>the killing of all the Spaniards</i> and the taking
possession of the islands.&rdquo;</p>
<p>VI. In his declaration made in Cavite<span class="corr" id=

&ldquo;the rebellion had for its object <i>the assassination of all the
peninsular Spaniards, the violation and beheading afterwards of their
wives and of their children even to the youngest</i>.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Many others might be cited; with these six samples an idea may be
gathered of the progressive idea advocated or fostered by Rizal, Pilar,
Lopez, Ponce, the Lunas, Rosario, Cort&eacute;s, and others who were
inspired by Morayta, the Grand Master of the Gran Oriente

<p id="n4"><span class="sc">Note 4.</span> The then Civil Governor of
Manila, in a report to the Colonial Minister concerning what was taking
place in Manila says, speaking of this Corps:</p>
<p>&ldquo;&hellip; this Corps of Vigilance which, although composed of

fruitful labor of making clear the <span class="corr" id="xd26e2239"

<p id="n5"><span class="sc">Note 5.</span> <i>Filibusters</i>: more
properly called separatists. Noah Webster describes a filibuster as a
&ldquo;lawless military adventurer, especially one in quest of plunder;
a free-booter, a pirate.&rdquo; Hence, taken in its true meaning, the
word does not apply to the separatists of the Philippines. Retana
classifies the filibuster in three groups: the first: he <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb87" href="#pb87" name="pb87">87</a>]</span>who,
thinking little or nothing of the independence of his country, showed
more or less aversion to the peninsular Spaniards. 2. He who, under the
pretext or without it, of illustrating his countrymen, inculcated into
their minds political ideas which, without meriting the qualification
of subversive, tended to incite <span class="corr" id="xd26e2252"
title="Source: then">them</span> against supposed oppressions of the
Spaniards; against all things which appeared behind the times, hence
according to their way of arguing, against the Religious Corporations,
to which they owed everything except their anti-Spaniardism. As a rule
those belonging to this group professed great love for the
mother-country and did not preach ideas of independence; they held the
belief that theirs was the duty to prepare the way for the emancipation
which should be attained by their grandchildren. And 3. Those whose aim
was to attain the emancipation of their country as soon as possible.
This latter group were the true separatists. It is however difficult to
distinguish between the filibuster so called, and the true separatist;
perhaps the only <span class="corr" id="xd26e2255" title=
"Source: admisible">admissible</span> distinction is that the
separatist is a man of peaceful methods whilst the <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb88" href="#pb88" name=
"pb88">88</a>]</span>filibuster is a man of struggles. Rizal was more
or less a separatist, Andr&eacute;s Bonifacio a veritable
filibuster.</p>
<p id="n6"><span class="sc">Note 6.</span> Sr. Olive was a gentleman
who well deserved the respect and honor paid to him by his nation, and
the hatred of those whose plans of treachery he thwarted and who, in
spiteful revenge, have gone so far as to accuse him of using torture
and other forcible means of <span class="corr" id="xd26e2264" title=

claim to have been false. Sr. Olive was too kind-hearted a man to stoop
to such methods even had the circumstances demanded the use of moderate
<span class="corr" id="xd26e2267" title=

<p>At one time Sr. Olive was the Governor of the Marianas Islands
concerning the which he wrote and published a very interesting memoir.
He was at that time Lieut. Colonel.</p>
<p>Later on he was made Colonel and as such was placed at the head of
one of the sections of the Guardia Civil of Manila. He was secretary of
the sub-inspection of arms of the Philippines. When a state of war was
declared, the charges which were at that time being prepared in
connection <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb89" href="#pb89" name=

Olive, who with a zeal worthy of praise, and an energy too seldom
exerted, commenced to deal out strict justice to the enemies of their
country. About a year and a half ago Sr. Olive was made General of
Brigade.</p>
<p id="n7"><span class="sc">Note 7.</span> According to a pamphlet
written by a <span class="corr" id="xd26e2280" title=
"Source: pseudonomous">pseudonymous</span> freemason and printed in
Paris in 1896, the first lodge founded in the Philippines was that
established in Cavite about 1860 under the name of <i lang="es">Luz
Filipina</i> and subject to the Gr&there4; Or&there4; Lusitian,
enjoying immediate correspondence with the Portuguese lodges of Macao
and <span class="corr" id="xd26e2286" title=
"Source: Hong-kong">Hong-Kong</span> which served as intermediaries
between that lodge and those of other neighboring countries.</p>
<p>Another statement however, from the pen of Sr. Nicolas Diaz y
P&eacute;rez who formed his data from the original documents of the
lodges, places the first foundation at the end of the year 1834. At
this time, says Sr. Diaz, D. Mariano Marti, who died twenty-seven years
later, whilst on his return to Spain, founded, together with others,
lodges in various parts of the Archipelago, but they did not prosper
and soon dissolved. <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb90" href="#pb90"
name="pb90">90</a>]</span>The epoch of intrigues which produced so much
disquietude and perversion of moral customs and ideas, more especially
in the Tagal provinces, commenced about 1868. The masonic activity at
that time was owing greatly to the political intriguers who were
deported from Spain to this archipelago, where their influence was felt
in no small degree, to the detriment of public morals.</p>
<p>About 1872, during the interim government of Gen. Blanco Valderrama,
a lodge was founded in Sampaloc, subject to the Gr&there4; Or&there4;
Esp&there4;, and composed entirely of peninsular Spaniards with the
exclusion of natives.</p>
<p>In the same year D. Rufino Pascual Torrej&oacute;n reached Manila
and united his efforts to those of Marti, founding lodges purely
Spanish.</p>
<p>On the first of March 1874 was created the lodge &ldquo;Luz de
Oriente&rdquo; under the obedience of the Gr&there4; Or&there4; de
Esp&there4;, the Gr&there4; Comend&there4; being D. Juan de la Somera.
This was really the first successful establishment of masonry in the
Philippines<span class="corr" title="Source: ,">.</span> The cited Sr.
Diaz y P&eacute;rez says on this point; &ldquo;It may be said that
freemasonry regularly constituted in the Philippines, dates from
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb91" href="#pb91" name=
"pb91">91</a>]</span>the 1st. of March 1874, with the creation of the
lodge <i lang="es">Luz de Oriente</i>&hellip;.&rdquo;</p>
<p>On the 1st of March 1875 was installed the Gr&there4; L&there4;
Departmental, D. Rufino Pascual Torrejon being the Gr&there4;
President.</p>
<p>Up to the year 1884 the lodges of the Philippines did not admit to
their <span class="corr" id="xd26e2311" title=
"Source: memberhip">membership</span> either indians or half-castes;
but since that time, and upon the initiative of the Gr&there4;
Mast&there4; of the Gr&there4; Or&there4; Esp&there4; the doors of the
lodges were opened to all indians and half-castes who could read or
write. Later on purely native lodges were founded and from that time
Spain lost, little by little but surely, her hold upon the people, with
the result that she eventually lost her colony. What masonry has
accomplished in other parts of the world it also accomplished here very
effectually. It laid the foundation for the undermining of society,
bringing forth a generation of traitors and building up a kingdom for
anti-Christ.</p>
<p>As has been proved over and over again by the many masonic documents
which have been discovered, freemasonry was ever anti-Catholic in the
Philippines; but it was not until it had degenerated into filibusterism
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb92" href="#pb92" name=
"pb92">92</a>]</span>that the anti-Spanish spirit really took shape.
Year by year <span class="corr" id="xd26e2319" title=
"Source: thisspirit">this spirit</span> spread and more, especially
among the natives and half-castes of less intellectual capacity. Among
this element, separatist ideas spread with marvelous rapidity owing to
the peculiarity of the character of the native and of the half-caste,
more especially the <span class="corr" id="xd26e2322" title=
"Source: chinese">Chinese</span> half-caste. (See note <a href=
"#n19">19</a>).</p>
<p>Up to 1890, even <span class="corr" title=
"Source: filipino">Filipino</span> masonry enjoyed but insignificant
development. By 1892, however, it had spread widely, and in the
following year Manila was gifted with a female lodge founded on the
18th of July of that year, under the name of &ldquo;La Semilla&rdquo;,
of which Rosario Villareal, the daughter of Faustino <span class="corr"
id="xd26e2333" title="Source: Villaruel">Villareal</span>, was declared
the Ven&there4; Gr&there4; Mistress.</p>
<p>From this time the element of politico-social decomposition gained
ground among the native and half-caste population. New ideas
continually gave place to the old and as the aims and purposes of the
lodges degenerated, these centers of anti-catholic propaganda became
more and more anti-Spanish.</p>
<p>Isabelo de los Reyes, in an attempted defense of his
&ldquo;friends&rdquo;, makes the important <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb93" href="#pb93" name=
"pb93">93</a>]</span>confession that &ldquo;Filipino freemasonry was
not so inoffensive as it was believed&#8202;&hellip;. The
&ldquo;Liga&rdquo; at least was a school of conspiracy, and in truth,
the <span class="corr" title="Source: filipinos">Filipinos</span> did
not turn out bad pupils.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Another demonstration of the inoffensiveness of freemasonry is the
following series of facts taken from a pamphlet published in 1896 in
Paris by Antonio Regidor under the pseudonym of Francisco Engracio
Vergara. Regidor was a distinguished figure in the attempted revolt of
1872, and hence may justly be supposed to know something of the matter
of which he speaks. He says:</p>
<p>&ldquo;By reason of the rising of Cavite many <span class="corr"

<p>&ldquo;The foreign masons distributed arms in Negros, Mindanao and

to aid also the escape of the deported in Marianas.&rdquo; <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb94" href="#pb94" name="pb94">94</a>]</span></p>
<p id="n8"><span class="sc">Note 8<span class="corr" title=
"Source: ,">.</span></span> <i>Rizal</i> and others: Of this group
Rizal, Pilar, the Lunas and Cort&eacute;s, formed the more guilty part,
they being men of superior education and more enlightened minds. Rizal
was the center upon which almost everything connected with the revolt
turned. During his younger days he lived with his parents in Calamba,
where they occupied a stretch of land owned by the Dominican
Corporation. The Rizal family was one of those most favored by the
Dominicans<a class="noteref" id="xd26e2382src" href="#xd26e2382" name=
"xd26e2382src">8</a>, and one of those ungrateful ones too, which
commenced law-suit against the said Corporation to unjustly possess
themselves of the land they held at rent.</p>
<p>Rizal received his <span class="corr" id="xd26e2399" title=
"Source: secondry">secondary</span> education at <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb95" href="#pb95" name="pb95">95</a>]</span>the
Ateneo Municipal conducted by the Jesuit Fathers, and was always a
bright attentive and successful pupil. At that time he was secretary of
the Sodality of the Blessed Virgin and Promoter of the Apostleship of
Prayer. Whilst he remained true to the traditions of Catholic Spain, he
was an upright pious youth. Much of his time he spent in carving wooden
images of the Blessed Virgin and of the Sacred Heart, and in writing
compositions, some of them remarkable for their beauty, in which were
reflected a pure love for Spain.</p>
<p>Having attained the degree of Bachelor he left the Ateneo and passed
to the University of Manila, continuing his studies under the Dominican
Fathers. There he studied medicine with great success for some years,
and at length went to Europe to terminate his career and take his
degrees.</p>
<p>Rizal left school like so many other filipino students, overloaded
with science he was unable to direct, full of pride because of his
accomplishments, and very ambitious. He terminated his studies in
Madrid and Germany, in both of which places he fell in with a class of
people who utilized him as a tool to accomplish an end at that time
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb96" href="#pb96" name=
"pb96">96</a>]</span>unknown to him. They filled his head with new and
false ideas, making him vain promises which appealed to his pride, and
by their dark arts made of him a <i>separatist</i>. He also studied
English and German, his studies in this latter language making him
enthusiastic in the things of Germany and, in an extraordinary degree,
with those of protestantism.</p>
<p>Among his own people he was the possessor of an exceptional
intelligence and talent but outside his own circle his most famous
accomplishments are but poor to the student of Literature. His sadly
famous <i lang="es">Noli me tangere</i> and <i lang="es">El
Filibusterismo</i> cannot pass for more than very second-hand for their
ingenuity and literary taste, but they possess the quality of being a
mirror in which is reflected the inclinations, character and perverse
moral sense of their author. In them he is reflected as a restless
spirit anxious for human glory, haughty and above all, anti-Spanish and
ungrateful in the extreme.</p>
<p>It was in Berlin that he published his <i>Noli</i> in 1886. That
this novel was written by Rizal there in no doubt, but that the ideas
therein expressed came directly from <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"pb97" href="#pb97" name="pb97">97</a>]</span>his own head is more than
doubtful. Like the vast majority of <span class="corr" title=
"Source: filipino">Filipino</span> productions, it is but a copy taken
from models which had struck the fancy of the author. The pictures he
draws therein of the disadvantages suffered by the <span class="corr"
title="Source: filipinos">Filipinos</span> who have become
espa&ntilde;olized, are but reproductions prepared in his own coarse
and crude way of thinking, of the most scurrilous anti-Spanish and
anti-Catholic works of propaganda produced by the Bible Societies and
spread abroad throughout the world as gospel truth. Taking away the
insults hurled against the Church and the Religious Orders, and against
Spain, there is absolutely nothing new in the novel. Its object was to
attack the friars and the chiefs of the Guardia Civil, both of which
the author well knew to be the sustainment and guarantee of peace and
order in the Archipelago and consequently the strongest support of the
Spanish <span class="corr" id="xd26e2435" title=
"Source: soverignty">sovereignty</span> in the Philippines, a
sovereignty he wished to overthrow. To a reader whose library consists
of a half a dozen books of insignificant literary value, the
<i>noli</i> of Rizal is a masterpiece; but to the reader who has seen a
book with a cover, who has had some experience <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb98" href="#pb98" name="pb98">98</a>]</span>of that
portion of the world which lies outside the limits of the town of his
birth, and who is gifted with more or less ability to think for
himself, and sift the wheat from the straw in a literary composition,
<i>noli me tangere</i> is but a half-tone picture cut from a newspaper
and colored with water-colors by a &hellip; school-boy.</p>
<p>Towards the end of 1887, Rizal returned to the Archipelago,
remaining about two months, during the which he made active propaganda
of the ideas and fancies he had picked up in Europe: ideas which he
himself could not really understand.</p>
<p>In February 1888 he left Manila for Japan, from whence he returned
to Europe, living for a while in Paris and later on in London.</p>
<p>In 1892 Rizal, relying upon the generous character of D. Eulogio
Despujols, the then Governor General of the Archipelago, decided to
return to Manila. From <span class="corr" id="xd26e2453" title=
"Source: Hong-kong">Hong-Kong</span> where he was then residing, he
wrote to the governor, asking permission to return to his home; the
Governor replied by means of the Spanish Consul at <span class="corr"
id="xd26e2456" title="Source: Hong-kong">Hong-Kong</span>, that he had
no reason to prohibit him from returning, and that he could do so when
it so pleased him, providing he came with <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"pb99" href="#pb99" name="pb99">99</a>]</span>no intention to disturb
the peace then reigning in the Islands.</p>
<p>This Rizal lost no time in doing; he arrived together with his
sister. The baggage of both was carefully examined and in one of the
trunks was discovered a bundle of leaflets in the form of anti-friar
proclamations which indicated the bad faith of a traitor. These were
handed over to Despujols unknown to Rizal. The Governor preserved them
in his desk for future reference. In an interview with the Governor,
Rizal begged pardon for his father who was under sentence of
deportation for certain events which had taken place in Calamba; this
was granted him without reserve.</p>
<p>Our hero soon forgot the aims he professed to the Governor; instead
of thinking about his folks and making his arrangements for the
colonizing scheme he professed to have worked out in Borneo, he set to
work to stir up disrespect towards the authorities, and the spirit of
political unrest. He together with Doroteo Cort&eacute;s and
Jos&eacute; Basa were the objects of careful vigilance on the part of
the secret police.</p>
<p>After a few days a <span class="corr" id="xd26e2467" title=
"Source: prolongued">prolonged</span> conference took place between the
Governor General <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb100" href="#pb100"
name="pb100">100</a>]</span>and Rizal. During this conference the
latter made patent his political feelings, at the same time making
protestations of respect for Spain. His political programme however was
not in keeping with his protestations of patriotism, and this fact so
angered Despujols, who now saw that Rizal&rsquo;s idea was to fool him,
that he took from his <span class="corr" id="xd26e2472" title=
"Source: draw">drawer</span> the proclamations discovered in the
agitator&rsquo;s baggage and thrusting them <span class="corr" id=
"xd26e2475" title="Source: ander">under</span> the nose of the traitor,
said:</p>
<p>&mdash;And these proclamations; what are they, what do they
mean?</p>
<p>Rizal taken by surprise and confounded, cowardly declared that they
were the property of his sister, a declaration which only enraged the
General the more, and he ordered his detention in Fort Santiago; on the
following day he decreed his deportation to Dapitan.</p>
<p>Whilst in exile his opinion and advice were <span class="corr" id=
"xd26e2484" title="Source: saught">sought</span> concerning the
advisability of immediate armed rebellion. But he, crafty, more or less
far seeing and, above all, jealous of Bonifacio&rsquo;s increasing
ascendancy over the people, refused to countenance the idea. Granting
the unselfish desire he professed of seeking merely the independence
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb101" href="#pb101" name=
"pb101">101</a>]</span>of his country, Rizal&rsquo;s <span class="corr"
id="xd26e2489" title="Source: jealously">jealousy</span> was justified.
Bonifacio&rsquo;s one great idea was the <i>presidency</i>;
Rizal&rsquo;s: the honor and glory of having prepared the way for, and
eventually, by his labors accomplishing his country&rsquo;s deliverance
from what he was pleased to call the <span class="corr" id="xd26e2495"
title="Source: oppresion">oppression</span> of the Spanish Government.
Had such <span class="corr" id="xd26e2499" title=

have been worthy of classifying <span class="corr" id="xd26e2502"

Washington was a man who deserved and received the respect of those
against whom he fought, for he fought for a principle. Such an honor
never has, and never can be received by Rizal from his own countrymen.
The campaign Rizal fought was inspired by and worked out in the
freemason lodges which used our &ldquo;hero&rdquo; as a willing tool.
Rizal was a <span class="corr" title="Source: filipino">Filipino</span>
Garibaldi, never a <span class="corr" title=

paid to his memory as a &ldquo;patriot&rdquo; must <span class="corr"

rooms which made <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb102" href="#pb102"

his country.</p>
<p>In Dapitan the <span class="corr" title=
"Source: filipino">Filipino</span> agitator was not inactive. On one
<span class="corr" id="xd26e2532" title=
"Source: occassion">occasion</span> he directed a letter (which never
reached its destination on account of its having fallen into the hands
of Spanish authorities) to the Capitan Municipal of the province of
Batangas, giving him information of the work of filibusterism which was
at that time being carried on.</p>
<p>Rizal, tiring of his position in Dapitan, eventually asked
permission of the Governor General, Gen. Blanco, to be sent to Cuba as
physician to the Spanish forces there. Blanco agreed to the proposition
and ordered his return to Manila in preparation for the voyage to
Spain, where he was to be sent and placed at the disposition of the
Minister of War.</p>
<p>From Spain came word, however, that the petition could not be
accepted; and for a very good reason. Rizal&rsquo;s idea of becoming an
army surgeon, was a manifest pretence, his real aim was to aid the
separatist movement there, if he ever got there, but <span class="corr"
id="xd26e2539" title="Source: primarly">primarily</span> to make his
escape at an intermediate port, Singapore probably<span class="corr"

Moreover, it having come <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb103" href=
"#pb103" name="pb103">103</a>]</span>to the ears of the authorities
that certain people of Pampanga <span class="corr" id="xd26e2547"
title="Source: aud">and</span> Bulacan were preparing a reception for
the agitator, the Governor ordered that he should not be allowed to
leave Dapitan, and that should he have left there, he should not be
allowed to land in Manila on his arrival, but be <span class="corr" id=
"xd26e2550" title="Source: transfered">transferred</span> to another
ship which should carry him back to Mindanao. It happened that he had
left Dapitan on board the S. S. Espa&ntilde;a, and in due time he
arrived at Manila. At 11 a. m. on the 6th of August the ship on which
he came anchored in the bay and everyone landed except Rizal. A
lieutenant of the Veterana went aboard and took possession of the
person of Rizal, holding him as a prisoner till <span class="corr" id=
"xd26e2554" title="Source: 7. 30">7:30</span> p. m., at which time,
through an error in the delivery of an order, he was allowed to
disembark. This he did in company with his sister Narcisa, and they
made their way to the office of the Captain of the Port and later on to
the Comandancia of the Veterana. His sister not having been under
sentence of <span class="corr" id="xd26e2557" title=
"Source: deporation">deportation</span>, was allowed to go to the home
of her relatives.</p>
<p>During the evening of the same day Gen. Blanco gave a reception at
Malaca&ntilde;ang at which were present the Archbishop <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb104" href="#pb104" name="pb104">104</a>]</span>of
Manila, the Illust. Sr. Bernardino Nozaleda; Sr. Echaluce; Sr.
Fernandez Victorio, President of Audiencia; <span class="corr" id=
"xd26e2564" title="Source: Sr:">Sr.</span> Bores Romero, the Civil
Director and others. During the reception Gen. Blanco received a
telegram from the Governor of the province of Batangas stating that in
the pueblo of Taal, in the house of the brother of the
<i>filibuster</i> Felipe Agoncillo, had been discovered a quantity of
arms and ammunition, among other things being 10 revolvers, 10
<span class="corr" id="xd26e2570" title=

explosive bullets, a quantity of dynamite, a Japanese flag, another
composed of red and blue with a representation of the sun in the center
surrounded by seven stars&mdash;the flag of the <i>future</i>
<span class="corr" title="Source: filipino">Filipino</span> republic.
Blanco realizing the importance of the news, formed a committee from
among those present, <span class="corr" id="xd26e2580" title=
"Source: chosing">choosing</span> those who were members of the Junta
of Authorities, to take steps in the matter. Orders were immediately
given that Rizal should be placed on board the cruiser Castilla which
was stationed at Cavite; this was carried out, the start from Manila
being made at 11 p. m. the same night. This action was considered
necessary, in as much as the news of the landing of <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb105" href="#pb105" name=
"pb105">105</a>]</span>Rizal spread fast and caused no little stir
among his followers.</p>
<p>Whilst Rizal was on board the cruiser Castilla which was awaiting
orders, the Katipunan revolt broke out in Manila and the suburbs. Very
soon afterwards his voyage Spainwards was commenced on board the S. S.
Colon, the insurrection becoming more and more wide-spread daily. On
finding to what an extent Rizal was complicated in the work of the
revolution, his return to the Archipelago, as a prisoner, was demanded,
and so our &ldquo;hero&rdquo; returned to be judged as were so many of
his fellow agitators, for the crimes for which he was morally and
physically responsible.</p>
<p>A council of war was constituted under the <span class="corr" id=
"xd26e2589" title="Source: precidency">presidency</span> of Lieut. Col.
Tabares, Capt. Tavil de Andrade taking charge of the defense of the
prisoner. The accusation preferred against him was that he was the
chief organizer of the revolution. The trial took place in the hall of
the Cuartel de Espa&ntilde;a in the presence of a large audience among
whom were his sister and the woman with whom he had been living in
Dapitan. The charge having been read out, several declarations were
made by Rizal, <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb106" href="#pb106" name=
"pb106">106</a>]</span>some before his voyage to Spain and others since
his return were also read. During his trial Rizal denied the knowledge
of several persons who were his intimate friends and co-workers; among
them Maximo Inocencio and Mariano Linjap, and others with whom he had
been in almost continual communication. He denied knowledge of the
&ldquo;Liga Filipina&rdquo; stating that not only did he not found it,
but that he was not aware of its existence. He affirmed ignorance of
who Valenzuela was, and almost immediately afterwards stated that he
had held an interview with him in Dapitan when that individual had been
sent there by Bonifacio to consult him on the subject of armed
rebellion. Throughout the whole trial he <span class="corr" id=
"xd26e2594" title="Source: persued">pursued</span> the same tactics,
proving that, of himself, he was but an ordinary <span class="corr"
title="Source: filipino">Filipino</span> indian who, when left to
himself to stand on his own merits, gave no signs of particular
judgement or power of thought. The <span class="corr" title=
"Source: filipino">Filipino</span> on trial, even for some significant
affair, cannot tell a lie to advantage: Rizal was no exception even in
this. The trial being ended he was condemned to execution.</p>
<p>Previous to meeting his death he confessed and received the Holy
Communion from <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb107" href="#pb107" name=
"pb107">107</a>]</span>the hands of the Jesuit Fathers having after
long consideration, made the following retraction of his errors:</p>
<blockquote>
<p class="first">&ldquo;I declare myself Catholic and in this religion
in which I was born and educated I wish to live and die. I retract with
all my heart all my words, writings and actions that have been contrary
to my condition as a son of the Catholic Church. I believe and profess
whatever She teaches and I submit to whatever She demands. I abominate
masonry as an enemy of the Church and as a society condemned by the
Church.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The diocesan prelate, as superior ecclesiastical authority,
may make public this spontaneous manifestation, to make reparation for
the scandals which may have been caused by my works, and that God and
my fellow-men may pardon me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Manila 29th December 1896.&mdash;Jos&eacute;
Rizal.&mdash;Witnesses: Juan del Fresno, Chief of Picket.&mdash;Eloy
Maure, Adjutant.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>He also entered the holy bonds of matrimony with the young woman
with whom he had been living for some time in Mindanao. On the way to
the place of his <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb108" href="#pb108"
name="pb108">108</a>]</span>execution he remarked to one of the Fathers
who accompanied him. <i>Father, it is my pride that has brought me
here.</i>&rdquo;</p>
<p>Of the political error committed by the Spanish Authorities in the
execution of Rizal, I do not hold myself up as a judge. All
governments, like human beings, commit mistakes and at times grave
ones. The Spanish authorities, feeling themselves justified in so
doing, ordered the execution of the <span class="corr" id="xd26e2624"
title="Source: prissoner">prisoner</span> who was responsible for one
of the most bloody revolts since the time of the French revolution: the
pattern taken by the <span class="corr" title=
"Source: filipino">Filipino</span> leaders, for the means of the
foundation of the <span class="corr" title=
"Source: filipino">Filipino</span> republic. Rizal was executed on the
Luneta. To assert that he was offered up as a victim to gratify the
wishes of the Religious Orders is but a crude and vicious argument
worthy of its inventors and propagators. Nothing, absolutely nothing,
can be brought forward to prove such an assertion, but on the contrary,
those members of the Religious Orders who concerned themselves in the
stirring affairs of the revolution were, as a very general rule,
opposed to harsh and extreme measures being taken; and among these was
the Illustrious Archbishop of Manila, <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"pb109" href="#pb109" name="pb109">109</a>]</span>Sr. Nozaleda, a
noble, tenderhearted and compassionate prelate<span class="corr" id=
"xd26e2635" title="Source: .">,</span> a prelate who has been dubbed by
Foreman as &ldquo;<i>the blood-thirsty
Archbishop</i>&rdquo;<span class="corr" title="Not in source">.</span>
Had the friars held the reins of government as they are stated to have
done, history would not have to record the names of so many, many
people who <span class="corr" id="xd26e2645" title=
"Source: where">were</span> executed: people who were scarcely to be
held as guilty, in as much as they were but sheep who <span class=
"corr" id="xd26e2648" title="Source: thoughtlessy">thoughtlessly</span>
followed their shepherds without even looking to see where the road
they trod would lead them.</p>
<p>In politics Rizal had his party composed of a number of
insignificant petty-lawyers, petty-doctors and others possessing
academic titles and a semi-formed cerebral power. These were backed by
a mass of the people of Calamba, Rizal&rsquo;s birthplace. In their
eyes he was a &ldquo;Messiah&rdquo;<span class="corr" id="xd26e2653"
title="Not in source">,</span> a &ldquo;Mahdi&rdquo;, their prophet and
redeemer. As an individual he was bright and intelligent, and had he
not been led astray by those who made a &ldquo;cat&rsquo;s paw&rdquo;
of him, and who cruelly deserted him in his hour of need, he would
doubtless have been one of the foremost <span class="corr" title=
"Source: filipinos">Filipinos</span> of to-day in that sphere of life
in which God had placed him.</p>
<p>A Spanish proverb says: <span class="corr" id="xd26e2661" title=
"Not in source">&ldquo;</span>In blind man&rsquo;s land the one eyed
man is a king.&rdquo; Rizal was a <i>king</i>. <span class=

<p id="n9"><span class="sc">Note 9.</span> Marcelo Hilario del Pilar y
Gatmaytan was a native of Bulacan. He was, by profession, a lawyer, and
had been enabled to complete his studies in that direction through the
good offices of the Augustinian Fathers of Manila, who had given him
the money necessary to matriculate and to pay the cost of his title of
&ldquo;<span lang="es">abogado</span>.&rdquo;<a class="noteref" id=
"xd26e2676src" href="#xd26e2676" name="xd26e2676src">9</a></p>
<p>Pilar left Manila for the <span class="corr" id="xd26e2681" title=
"Source: peninsular">peninsula</span> about the end of &rsquo;88 for
fear of deportation: a punishment at that time staring him in the face.
He was one of the earliest workers on the &ldquo;La Solidaridad&rdquo;,
the official organ of <span class="corr" title=
"Source: filipino">Filipino</span> freemasonry in all its sections. He
later on became its director.</p>
<p>Pilar was another of the many malays whose ways were beyond human
comprehension. Spaniards who have lived a life-time among the indians
and studied them carefully from all points of view agree that the
deeper one studies the native character the more incomprehensible it
becomes. That is, the study of the average filipino: Pilar was one of
the average. He was not gifted with the education enjoyed by Rizal, nor
was he such a stupid visionary as Pedro Paterno; he possessed touches
of the character of both. <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb111" href=
"#pb111" name="pb111">111</a>]</span></p>
<p>Like so many of those <span class="corr" title=
"Source: filipinos">Filipinos</span> who fed at the hands of the
Religious Orders, he eventually turned to bite the hand that fed him.
As in the case of the others who had done the like, he did so, not
because he had cause to, but because he fell, as did they, under the
evil influence of those who utilized them to work out their schemes of
treachery.</p>
<p>Pilar was sent to Spain as a delegate of the Committee of
propaganda. Owing to this position of chief of the delegation in
Madrid, and by reason of his intimate friendship with Morayta, he
occupied a position from which neither Rizal nor even the whole of the
<i>progressive</i> indians combined, could drive him. He held, for some
time, high office in the Gr&there4; Or&there4; Esp&there4; as will be
seen from the following clipping taken from page 107 of the Annual of
that Orient for the year 1894&ndash;95.</p>
<blockquote lang="es">
<p class="first xd26e194">&ldquo;GRAN CONS&there4; DE LA ORDEN<br>

</blockquote>
<p>It was Pilar who conceived the plan of <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"pb112" href="#pb112" name="pb112">112</a>]</span>the Katipunan; and
yet after all it was not his conception, for the scheme he formed was
at the best, a piece of patch work made up of the plans worked out in
the various revolutions which had taken place in some part of the
world.</p>
<p>What Pilar&rsquo;s ambition was, it is hard to say; from his actions
and writings one is almost driven to the supposition that he had none
in particular, but was led to the separatist labors he performed by
force of compromise.</p>
<p>When the time was ripe for action Pilar determined to leave Madrid
and make his way to Japan. He commenced the journey arriving at
Barcelona, from whence he was to make his way east. There, however, he
was taken suddenly ill, and died on the 4th of June 1896, in the
Hospital of that city.</p>
<p>In many things Pilar was superior to Rizal. Unlike that agitator,
Pilar was not a sneaking, skulking petty-politician; he was
straight-forward and had the courage of his opinions. What Pilar would
have done if placed in the same circumstances as Rizal it is hard to
say, but we may be assured that he would not have acted the coward as
did Rizal. <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb113" href="#pb113" name=

and remained under the guidance of his master, showed no little talent.
Antonio went to Spain in &rsquo;88, and later on passed to Paris where
he lived with his brother Juan who supported him. There he devoted
himself to the study which made him famous; this he did in the
<span class="corr" id="xd26e2746" title=

assistant editor of the <i>Solidaridad</i>, the official organ of
filipino freemasonry, and wrote many vicious articles in its columns
over the pseudonym of Taga-Ilog<span class="corr" title=

known as Gay Lussac.</p>
<p>On his return to Manila he established, for a livelihood, a school

under whom he studied, receiving an exceptional education both in art
and in morals, Sr. Vera being a <span class="corr" id="xd26e2813"
title="Source: christian">Christian</span> gentleman. Later on he went
to Rome, and there formed part of the Spanish artistic colony. After
some two or three years of study there he sent to Spain his first
painting<a class="noteref" id="xd26e2816src" href="#xd26e2816" name=

than it really deserved, as a result of the influence of Luna&rsquo;s
friends. From Rome he went to Paris. It was in that city that he
committed the fiendish double murder which so startled and shocked his
friends and acquaintances, his victims being his wife and his
mother-in-law, sister and mother of a prominent political aspirant of
modern Manila. The result of the trial was that the courts of Justice
of Paris absolved him. He then returned to Madrid, and soon after, to
Manila.</p>
<p>What Spain did for the Filipino brought <span class=

under her beneficent christian influence. The Lunas were among the few.
They, like so many other ungrateful children, repaid their benefactors
by becoming leaders of the insensate and inexcusable revolt against
them: a revolt, the first act of which was to be the brutal murder of
all Spaniards irrespective of parentage or other claims of
consideration. Both the brothers suffered arrest by the Spanish
authorities for rebellion <span class="corr" id="xd26e2849" title=

they were complicated, they remained practically free from punishment,
and ever at the right hand of the imbecile General Blanco, himself a
freemason, and friend of the enemies of his country. Eventually the two
brothers left the <span class="corr" id="xd26e2852" title=

<p>Both brothers eventually retracted their errors only to fall into

<p id="n14"><span class="sc">Note 14.</span> <i>Tagalog</i>: The
Tagalogs are a branch of the Malay family which, in former times,
dominated from Madagascar to the ends of the Pacific. They form part of
what we might call the Malay-Chinee race, i. e. the cross between the
female on the Malay side and the Chinee on the side of the male. This
cross has been taking place from time immemorial, commencing long
before the islands were discovered by the Spanish explorers. The
present Tagalog indian enjoys more of the characteristics of the Chinee
than of the Malay on account of the potency of the <span class="corr"
id="xd26e3020" title="Source: chinee">Chinee</span> blood over the
<span class="corr" id="xd26e3023" title=
"Source: malay">Malay</span>.</p>
<p>Going back to ancient times the probability is that the original
Malay first became modified by its crossing with the inhabitants proper
of the archipelago&mdash;the <span class="corr" id="xd26e3029" title=
"Source: negritos">Negritos</span>&mdash;marks of which mixture are
still <span class="corr" id="xd26e3032" title=
"Source: descernable">discernible</span> in <span class="corr" id=
"xd26e3035" title="Source: may">many</span> of the Tagalogs.</p>
<p>A second modification came through the mixture between the
Malay-Negrito and the Indonesian, traces of which are seen in the light
color of the skin in a portion, although small, of the Tagalogs.
Another modification, the most marked, originated from the crossing of
the Malay-Negrito-Indonesian <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb124" href=
"#pb124" name="pb124">124</a>]</span>with the Chinee, the <span class=
"corr" id="xd26e3042" title="Source: chinee">Chinee</span> being marked
by the increase in stature, the elevation of the skull and other minor
marks.</p>
<p>During the last three centuries this hybrid Tagalog has undergone
another small and gradual change by reason of a limited crossing with
Spanish blood. This latter mixture however is insignificant in extent
but always produces a superior type. As a people the Tagalogs number
about one and a half millions, and inhabit the regions around about
Manila. The traits of character of the four principal trunks from which
the <span class="corr" id="xd26e3047" title=
"Source: tagalog">Tagalog</span> of to-day is derived are, although
still present in a greater or lesser degree, considerably modified by
climatological and historical circumstances.</p>
<p>At the coming of the Spaniards the Tagalogs, like the remaining
native peoples of the archipelago, were met with in the depths of the
savage ages, and were to a certain extent, of cannibalistic
tendencies.</p>
<p>The <span class="corr" id="xd26e3054" title=
"Source: avarage">average</span> Tagalog is not wanting in courage, a
fact he has often displayed, but this courage is never seen to
advantage except when the indian is under the leadership of a person of
exceptional valor or a strict disciplinarian. Like most peoples
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb125" href="#pb125" name=
"pb125">125</a>]</span>derived from the Malay stock, the Tagalog indian
is subject to strange fits of mental aberration, the fits taking
different forms, generally innocent ones, the worst being a homicide
under the <span class="corr" id="xd26e3059" title=
"Source: influencie">influence</span> of a &ldquo;hot head&rdquo;. At
least that is what might have been said of him 8 or 10 years ago,
previous to the time in which he became fanaticised by
freemasonry<span class="corr" title="Source: ,">.</span> He is not even
yet apt to run <i>amok</i> as is usual among the Malays and this is
undoubtedly due to the civilizing religious influence which has been
brought to bear upon him during the three centuries of Spanish rule in
the Archipelago. It is a noteworthy fact that in the same degree as the
influence of religion, of the Religious Orders if you will, became
<span class="corr" id="xd26e3069" title="Source: lessed">lesser</span>,
in exactly equal degree did crime increase. Explain this as you will
the fact remains that during the four years or so that the indian has
been under the care and protection of a government indifferent to all
religion, crime has increased a hundred fold, perhaps arithmetically so
also, and crimes unheard of in days gone by, have become so common as
scarcely to merit mention in the columns <span class="corr" id=
"xd26e3072" title="Source: af">of</span> Manila&rsquo;s yellow
journalism. What the Tagalog <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb126" href=
"#pb126" name="pb126">126</a>]</span>indian is equal to when free from
the restraint of the Catholic religion, has been seen from the fearful
crimes and barbarities committed against Spaniards and against
Americans during the insurrection. The brutalities <span class="corr"
id="xd26e3077" title="Source: commited">committed</span> upon the
unfortunate prisoners who fell into their hands were unheard of even
among the savage <span class="corr" id="xd26e3080" title=

"Source: chinese">Chinese</span> <i>boxers</i> yet told us of things
equal to the fearful events which took place in the province of Cavite
and elsewhere. And for all this the Tagalog indian is responsible: the
Tagalog for whom Pedro Paterno claims a pre-Spanish civilization on the
plan of the Aztec and ancient Peruvian indians. Like all oriental
peoples the Tagalog is superstitious and loves demonstration, symbolism
and things grotesque. About the only thing left to him of his ancient
<i>civilization</i> as Paterno calls it, <span class="corr" id=
"xd26e3096" title="Source: barberism">barbarism</span> we generally
say, is his mythology. In it everything is more or less connected with
spirits. Their faith in what they call their <i>anting
anting</i><a class="noteref" id="xd26e3101src" href="#xd26e3101" name=
"xd26e3101src">16</a> is unbreakable. Rizal was supposed to
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb127" href="#pb127" name=
"pb127">127</a>]</span>be under the protection of the
<i>anting-anting</i> but the leaden <span class="corr" id="xd26e3113"
title="Source: missles">missiles</span> which took away his life
carried away the <i>anting-anting</i> also: and yet there are thousands
upon thousands of indians, some of them men of enlightenment, who still
cling to the belief that Rizal still lives, thanks to the influence of
his protecting amulet. Nor did <i>anting anting</i> avail Aguinaldo who
now probably believes far more in the protection of his American prison
than in that offered by his <i>anting anting</i> charms.</p>
<p>Their mythology has, like their ancient character, been greatly
modified in the vast majority, by the influence of the civilization
implanted by Spain. This is one point in which Spain has differed from
most nations in methods of civilization and colonization. However we
may judge her in respect to her colonial administration in the
Philippines, we cannot deny that she has been distinguished from other
nations by her aim of preserving the native races of the archipelago,
the destruction consequent upon the radical change undergone in
everything, being limited to the savage customs and immoralities in
which the native peoples were found submerged. <span class=

<p>The masonic lodges spoken of in the text which were asked of
Morayta, were <span class="corr" id="xd26e3130" title=
"Source: estabished">established</span>, although they were not
exclusively Tagalog in their membership. As a result of the petition of
the <span class="corr" title="Source: filipino">Filipino</span> colony
mentioned in the same text, the theories and practices of Masonry were
carried to the Tagalogs but instead of the needy brethren being aided
by the wealthy ones, they were subjected to a contribution in
<span class="corr" id="xd26e3136" title=
"Source: exhange">exchange</span> for which they received a gaudy
regalia; in other words they were bought over with strings of beads and
with tinsel truck as were the indians discovered by Capt. Cook in the
South Sea Islands, with the exception that Capt. Cook and those who
followed him carried civilization to the natives, whilst the founders
of the Katipunan carried to the Tagalogs and the other indians of the
archipelago misery and demoralization.</p>
<p id="n15"><span class="sc">Note 15</span>. <i>Faustino Villaruel
Gomara</i> was a Spanish half-caste, a native of Pandaran, living in
Binondo. He was the founder of the lodge &ldquo;La Patria&rdquo; of
which he was also the Ven&there4; Gr&there4; Master with grade 18. He
also founded a lodge of female freemasons, for the foundation of which
he <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb129" href="#pb129" name=
"pb129">129</a>]</span>committed the nefarious crime of prostituting
his daughter, handing her over, in the period of her innocence and
<span class="corr" id="xd26e3148" title=
"Source: candour">candor</span>, to the ridiculous workings and
practices of freemasonry. Rosario Villaruel (Minerva), thus sacrificed
by her father, was initiated in Hong-Kong and made venerable of the
first lodge of female masons in Manila, drawing in after her a large
number of her half-caste friends, young folk of bare instruction. This
lodge was known as &ldquo;La Semilla&rdquo;. Its composition was:
Sisters: Carlota Zamora, of Calle Crespo; Mar&iacute;a Teresa Bordas,
of Tabaco, province of Albay; Fabiana Robledo, wife of Sixto Celis;
Lorenza Nepomuceno, of Calle San Jos&eacute;, Trozo; Angelica Lopez,
Calle Jolo; Narcisa Rizal; Mar&iacute;a Dizon, Calle Trozo, and other
fanatic females.</p>
<p>Villaruel was the Gr&there4; Oriente of filipino masonry, a deluded
fanatic, a man of but scarce intellectual endowments, an instrument of
those who knew more and were shrewder than he. By laying hands upon him
the Spanish Authorities laid hands also upon a large number of
incriminating documents which were the means of connecting many
prominent business men of Manila with the <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"pb130" href="#pb130" name="pb130">130</a>]</span>bloody programme of
the Katipunan. Among these was Francisco L. Roxas.</p>
<p>Besides these documents were a large number of loose papers written
<span class="corr" id="xd26e3157" title="Source: is">in</span>
<span class="corr" id="xd26e3160" title=
"Source: tagalog">Tagalog</span>, in which were discovered many
threatening phrases and the expression of hopes in the success of an
event to take place in the near future. Masks and other masonic
implements, including a heavily made and sharply pointed dagger were
also discovered.</p>
<p>Previous to suffering the <span class="corr" id="xd26e3165" title=
"Source: penality">penalty</span> of his treason he made and signed a
public abjuration, for the copy of which see Appendix <a href=
"#appe">E</a>.</p>
<p id="n16"><span class="sc">Note 16.</span> Andr&eacute;s Bonifacio
was the soul of the Katipunan movement; he was the President of the
&ldquo;Council of Ministers of the Supreme Popular Council.&rdquo; His
social condition was of a low grade, that grade from which many of the
most fanatical pseudo-reformers have come; he was a warehouseman, a
porter. In this capacity he was employed in the establishment of Messrs
Fressel and Co., and was one of the humblest of the employees.</p>
<p>Bonifacio was, however, very vain and quixotic. He was, too, a man
of sanguinary character, and held the people over whom <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb131" href="#pb131" name="pb131">131</a>]</span>he
attained ascendancy, in awe. His ambition was the cause of his
ignominious downfall and brutal murder at the hands of another
self-asserted dictator of the filipino Commune. Like most of his kind,
he was a great reader, and by those who knew him best he was likened to
Don Quixote, for like that worthy he passed many a night burning away
oil and candles, and sacrificing needed sleep in reading, until his
brain was turned and his whole mind given up to ideas of revolutions.
His favorite study was the French Revolution, from the which he learned
many lessons which he utilized in his projects, the principal of which
was the formation of a government after the style of the French
Commune. He was astute and comparatively intelligent, and spoke the
<span class="corr" id="xd26e3180" title=
"Source: tagalog">Tagalog</span> dialect well. For the carrying out of
his plans he had agents in every nook and corner. No place <span class=
"corr" id="xd26e3183" title="Source: were">where</span> information
might be gathered or the work of propaganda done, was over-looked. The
offices of the Civil Government had their quota of his spies, as also
did the <span lang="es">Intendencia</span>, the <span lang=
"es">Maestraza de Artilleria</span> and the other large centers. Nor
were the Convents and Colleges overlooked, nor even <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb132" href="#pb132" name="pb132">132</a>]</span>the
big business Corporations.</p>
<p>Bonifacio enjoyed an envied ascendancy over the lower classes and
the ignorant. Like others of similar tendencies, Bonifacio knew how to
exploit the &ldquo;membership&rdquo;. He was at one time treasurer of
the Katipunan, and upon one occasion after the examination of the books
by the president of the society Andr&eacute;s was denounced as an
exploiter, the accounts being found in a very bad condition. A series
of mutual squabbles and insults passed between the president Roman
Basa, and Bonifacio, the whole affair ending up in a re-election of
officers, Bonifacio being chosen as president. This occurred towards
the end of the year 1893.</p>
<p>The vanity of Bonifacio was comparable only to that of Aguinaldo.
Among the number of chief workers of the Katipunan was a certain
Valenzuela, a doctor who had, according to his own confession, been
forced into the membership by Bonifacio, on the strength of a
&ldquo;love&rdquo; affair; he was given the choice of membership or
death. He chose the <span class="corr" id="xd26e3199" title=
"Source: latter">former</span> but later on resigned. Whilst a member
he enjoyed a salary of 30 pesos a month as medical officer, but only
with difficulty could he collect his pay. He claimed <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb133" href="#pb133" name="pb133">133</a>]</span>to
have been exploited by Bonifacio who, whilst merely a porter, could
thus have at his command the free services of a real doctor, spurning
the services of the petty physicians which abound in Manila. Nor was
this all. His own (Bonifacio&rsquo;s) house having been burned down, he
went, on the strength of this same &ldquo;love&rdquo; affair, to live
in the house of the said doctor (see foot-note p. 48), taking with him
his paramour, the doctor paying the greater part of the expenses thus
incurred.</p>
<p>At the time of the organization of the popular Supreme Councils,
Bonifacio was chosen president of the Council of Trozo; but in
consequence of internal troubles occasioned by his rebelliousness, the
Supreme Council decided to dissolve the local Council. Bonifacio, true
to his colors, disregarded this order and continued working on his own
account, taking upon himself the faculties of the Supreme Council.</p>
<p>He preserved in a case which was found in the warehouse of Messrs
Fressel and Co., the organization of the &ldquo;Filipino
Republic&rdquo; which was to be, as well as a number of regulations,
codes, decrees of nominations, etc., all drawn up in Tagalog (see
foot-note p. 49.) <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb134" href="#pb134"
name="pb134">134</a>]</span></p>
<p>Upon the discovery, on the 19th of August 1896, by the Augustinian
Padre fray Mariano Gil, parish priest of Tondo, of the plot of the
<i>Katipuneros</i>, Bonifacio and his immediate assistants fled from
Manila to Caloocan. From that point he sent orders to the provinces of
Manila, Cavite and Nueva Ecija that a general rising should take place
on the 30th of that month. These orders were given out of revenge for
the failure of the blood-thirsty plot whereby every Spaniard, man,
woman or child should share in the sufferings which his diseased brain
had concocted for those who should fall into his hands. Bonifacio
issued special orders concerning the Governor General, his plan being
that he and the other Spanish authorities of any importance should be
taken prisoners, but not killed, it being intended to hold their
persons as security for the granting of their demands. He called
together the members of the Junta Superior and nominated a
general-in-chief, a general of division and other officials. These
however refused to step into the places he had prepared for them and
Bonifacio angered thereat threatened to have the head removed from the
shoulders of anyone who dared to disobey him. <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb135" href="#pb135" name="pb135">135</a>]</span>The
general-in-chief Teodoro Plata, a cousin of Bonifacio, fled during the
night following his nomination, whereupon Bonifacio issued orders for
his capture, commanding his death wherever he should be found.</p>
<p>Sometime previous to this, about the month of May, Bonifacio sent
Pio Valenzuela to Dapitan to hold a conference with Rizal concerning
the convenience of immediate rebellion against Spain. Rizal would not
consent to the projected revolt but opposed the idea most strenuously,
being thrown into such a bad humor by the information he received of
Bonifacio, that Valenzuela, who had gone to Dapitan intending to spend
a month there, determined to return on the following day. On his return
to Manila he recounted to Bonifacio the result of his mission.
Bonifacio who knew Rizal&rsquo;s influence over the people to be
greater than his own, had been living in hopes of receiving
Rizal&rsquo;s consent which would be the surrendering to him of the
whole responsibility and glory of the bloody enterprise. Bonifacio
aspired to the absolute, like all the so-called leaders of the revolt;
so when he realized the stand taken by Rizal, who was willing to wait
patiently till the poison with which he had inoculated <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb136" href="#pb136" name="pb136">136</a>]</span>the
people should work of itself, he flew into a rage like a spoilt child,
declaring Rizal to be a coward and imposing upon Valenzuela, his
messenger, implicit silence on this subject, prohibiting him from
manifesting to anyone what he considered to be the bad exit of the
consultation.</p>
<p>No methods were too underhand for Bonifacio; to gain his end he lied
to the people over whom he held sway as only a <span class="corr"
title="Source: filipino">Filipino</span> can lie. On one occasion he
affirmed that in Coregidor was a vessel loaded with arms and ammunition
for the rebels, and by this means he animated them, a very necessary
thing at that time, as they were but scantily armed with bolos and were
no match against those they intended to assail.</p>
<p>Taking him all in all, Bonifacio was a first class organizer for
such an enterprise as that aimed at by the Katipunan, and upon his
shoulders lies the weight of the greater part of the iniquities of the
diabolical society. He ordered the outbreak and in a <span class="corr"
id="xd26e3227" title="Source: skilfull">skillful</span> manner pulled
the strings which worked the figures which formed the performers in the
marionette revolution. He had rivals in the field however, the most
powerful being Aguinaldo, the would be <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"pb137" href="#pb137" name="pb137">137</a>]</span>president of the
mushroom republic. After the encounter at San Juan del Monte in which
the insurgents suffered the loss of 95 killed and 42 taken prisoners in
the first instance, and shortly afterwards of 200 more, Bonifacio
escaped, carrying with him the funds of the Katipunan, some 20,000
pfs.<a class="noteref" id="xd26e3232src" href="#xd26e3232" name=
"xd26e3232src">17</a> He was supposed to be in hiding in the most
<span class="corr" id="xd26e3241" title=
"Source: inaccesible">inaccessible</span> parts of the mountains of San
Mateo, in as much as he had told Pio Valenzuela that in case the
movement were unsuccessful he had determined to retire to that point to
devote himself to highway robbery<a class="noteref" id="xd26e3244src"
href="#xd26e3244" name="xd26e3244src">18</a>, to foot-padding, an idea
gotten <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb138" href="#pb138" name=
"pb138">138</a>]</span>from some modern French novel probably. He
worked his way eventually into Cavite, and, according to information
gotten from Pedro Gonzalez, he fell into the disfavor of Aguinaldo who
saw his own superiority in danger of being supplanted; the <i lang=
"es"><span class="corr" id="xd26e3256" title=
"Source: generalismo">generalisimo</span></i> therefore put a price
upon his head<a class="noteref" id="xd26e3259src" href="#xd26e3259"
name="xd26e3259src">19</a>. A party was sent in search for the runaway
and upon his capture he was subjected to most brutal treatment, and at
last fell a victim to the unprincipled ambition of the Dictator.</p>
<p>Had Bonifacio lived he would have made a splendid acquisition to the
Partido Federal, he being a man who could, like many of the
self-asserted leaders of to-day, plan and follow out any double-faced
policy that might be needed under the circumstances. <span class=

<p id="n19"><span class="sc">Note 19.</span> The character of the
native: this is a subject upon which one might write many volumes
without conveying to the minds of his readers more than a faint idea of
what that strange character is.</p>
<p>More mysterious than the most profound mystery of Religion, his most
striking trait of character being a decided <span class="corr" id=
"xd26e3289" title="Source: tendancy">tendency</span> to retrogression,
the Malay stands out among the numerous divisions of the human family
as a man with a marked propensity to the mysterious, to the prodigious.
He is accustomed to give a blind obedience to his superiors and more so
to his own caciques, he is docile as a general rule, and shows but
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb140" href="#pb140" name=
"pb140">140</a>]</span>little resentment to abusive language, although
he will sometimes carefully guard the <span class="corr" id="xd26e3294"
title="Source: rememberance">remembrance</span> of some insignificant
insult or blow, and take a cruel revenge, a thousand times greater than
the injury he received, after a period, at times, of years. Other
peculiarities of the native are his delight in gambling and
cockfighting, his aversion to manual labor, his infantile but excessive
vanity, his lack of the power of thought in matters of moment, his well
developed imagination, his instability from all points of view and his
liability to complete and radical changes. The average indian is to-day
virtuous, honest and grateful for favors received, tomorrow he is
vicious, <span class="corr" id="xd26e3297" title=
"Source: theiving">thieving</span> and shows an ingratitude not to be
found even in the brute creation. This very marked trait of character
may be found in many of the <span class="corr" title=
"Source: filipinos">Filipinos</span> who have held and still hold some
of the highest official positions in the islands.</p>
<p>To sum up the <span class="corr" title=
"Source: filipino">Filipino</span> indian in a few words: he is
inexplicable. There have been those who have spent their lives in the
study of the indian, but in spite of all that man can do to study man,
the problem remains unsolved. Only those &ldquo;globe trotters&rdquo;

who had the honor of conducting such <i lang="es">savants</i> to and

character which has puzzled men of common sense and lifelong
experience, for centuries.</p>
<p>Being by nature credulous, ignorant and superstitious, the indian
fell an easy victim to the mysteries of freemasonry, which served him
as are introduction to the semi-savage methods of the &ldquo;Liga
Filipina&rdquo; and the barbarous practices of the Katipunan, the
<i lang="es">pacto-de-sangre</i> of which, carried him back to the

Reg&there4; was installed in 1893. A masonic document bearing a seal
&ldquo;<i>Gr&there4; Consejo Regional de Filipinas. G&there4;

from a letter of the illustrious bro&there4; Kupang (Marcelo H. del
Pilar) dated from Madrid on the 17th December 1894, says: &ldquo;D.

<p id="n24"><span class="sc">Note 24.</span> La Solidaridad was the
official organ of <span class="corr" title=
"Source: filipino">Filipino</span> freemasonry in all its branches.
Although it was published in the peninsula its circulation was intended
for the Philippines. Its editors were the leaders of the disaffection
against the metropolis <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb143" href=
"#pb143" name="pb143">143</a>]</span>and stout advocates, indirectly,
of an impossible independence. The chief aim of the paper was to
mortify everything Spanish, and to this end its columns were
continually full of seditious articles aimed, not merely at individuals
but at the State. Its diatribes against the Government of the
Metropolis were of the bitterest nature, and therefore but little
publicity was given to the sheet in Madrid, where it was printed. It
enjoyed no exchange with the periodicals of importance of the city, had
no street sales, nor was it exposed for sale publicly. The libraries
did not carry it on their tables and it never reached the hands of the
public authorities. In fact the people of the official element know
nothing of its existence.</p>
<p>In the office of this bi-monthly paper was established a freemason
lodge bearing the same name as the paper; all the members of the
Association Hispano-Filipina became members of the lodge. Being the
organ of masonry as well as of separatism it was introduced into the
Archipelago and secured a free circulation in all parts of the
principal islands where its calumnies against the Religious Orders had
the effect of producing a decided effect upon the maintenance
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb144" href="#pb144" name=

<p>The statement that the bi-monthly was founded by Pilar is erroneous;
it was first published by Lopez Jaena in Barcelona where it enjoyed its
enforced life till it reached its number 18, of October 1889, when it
suddenly ceased publication on account of the seizure by the
authorities of a number of incriminating documents and pamphlets. It
recommenced publication in Madrid on the 15th of November of the same
year. It was later on acquired by Pilar and Morayta<span class="corr"

"xd26e3402src">22</a>. Centeno and Quiroga Ballesteros worked hard to
undermine the beneficial influence of the Clergy, an influence which
was the safe-guard of law and order. Their most famous piece of work
was the manifestation of &rsquo;88 against Archbishop Payo (See note
<a href="#n2">2</a>). In that manifestation was conceived the cry of
sedition which was later on to ring throughout the archipelago and tear
down the banner of the fatherland to replace it with the red flag of
anarchy; a flag which well nigh brought the people of a would be
independent country to the verge of political and moral
destruction.</p>

had to contend against these powers of evil; and there is therefore
little necessity for surprise that those who were employed in such work
as were the unscrupulous persons who came to the archipelago to sow
ruin in the consciences of the people and scandal in society, should
carry on a bitter campaign against the Religious Orders to whom was
owing every jot and tittle of the civilization and culture enjoyed by
the <span class="corr" title="Source: filipinos">Filipinos</span>. The
Monastic Orders have ever been the bulwark of Christianity, and as such
have had to bear the brunt of the battle. Europe owes the solid
foundation of its political, social and religious life to the Religious
Orders, which, during the ages in which the Huns, Goths and other
barbarians overran and devastated those lands, hoarded up in the nooks
and corners of their monastic dwellings the seed which, when afterwards
sown, was to become the stout tree of civilization which should spread
its sheltering branches to the four corners of the earth. One of these
branches drawing its <span class="corr" id="xd26e3427" title=

the trunk, extended to these far off islands and, casting its shade
over the embruted mankind here existing at that time, wrought a change
over it no less marked than that wrought over the European peoples.
From the day in which Father Urdaneta, that intrepid Augustinian, set
foot upon Philippine soil<span class="corr" id="xd26e3435" title=
"Source: .">,</span> till the day upon which the hydra-headed Katipunan
appeared in the land, the Monastic Orders have been the one great
source of all that was really useful and beneficial to the inhabitants
of the archipelago, although at times the moral interests of the people
were not the commercial interests of the country.</p>
<p>The &ldquo;friar&rdquo; so much slandered by those who wish to
overthrow his <span class="corr" id="xd26e3440" title=
"Source: beneficient">beneficent</span> influence, ever carried the
banner of his country enlaced with the Cross of the Redeemer. He came
to the Archipelago as a messenger of peace and order, and was the
strongest supporter of the sovereignty of his nation. The
&ldquo;friar&rdquo; was hated because he was the one who best knew and
understood the indian, and from his intimate knowledge of his
<span class="corr" id="xd26e3443" title=

sovereignty.</p>
<p>The <span class="corr" id="xd26e3453" title=
"Source: compaign">campaign</span> against the Religious Orders was the
attack of the battering-rams against the city to be captured. By
piercing the wall the entry into the city could be the easier made; and
this the separatist element well knew, hence all their efforts were
directed against the stout wall which defended from its assaults the
treasure <span class="corr" id="xd26e3456" title=
"Source: of of">of</span> the metropolis.</p>
<p>For three hundred years the Philippines remained submitted to Spain
exclusively by reason of the moral influence of the Clergy. Whilst the
banner of Spain, floated over the Archipelago, the Religious formed the
strongest guard for its protection; when it fell, strung by the
ingratitude and treachery of those who had sworn to defend it to the
last drop of their blood, and lay dishonored in the dust, it was the
Religious who bowed his head in the deepest grief and who shed the
bitterest tears. When the flag of the conquerer was hauled up to the
height from which once gloriously floated the symbol of Spanish
authority, the Religious, obedient to the commands of his superiors,
withdrew to the solicitude of his convent, to await in patience, the
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb149" href="#pb149" name=

clouded political horizon, as Noah looked out from the window of the
ark upon the vast sea of waters which hid from his view the fearful
<span class="corr" id="xd26e3463" title=

patiently awaiting the time when he should, at God&rsquo;s will, go
forth to commence again the work of reconstruction.</p>
<p>Often have I heard the opinion expressed that the Government&rsquo;s
worst enemy is the &ldquo;friar&rdquo;, that it is the
&ldquo;friar&rdquo; who keeps alive the spirit of rebellion. Let those
<span class="corr" id="xd26e3468" title="Source: who who">who</span>
think thus, ponder over one small thought: what has the friar to gain
in sustaining a rebellion which has caused him more moral and material
damage, than has been caused to any other entity in the Philippines? To
those who are able and willing to utilize the power of thought with
which God has endowed them, it is sufficiently clear that the Religious
has nothing to gain by such tactics, but, on the contrary, all to
lose.</p>
<p>In Spanish times the native enemies of the Religious Orders were the
enemies of Spain and in these days, the enemy of the friar is by no
means a real friend, whatever he may claim to be, of the Government of
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb150" href="#pb150" name=
"pb150">150</a>]</span>of the U. S. The Spanish masons and the
<span class="corr" title="Source: filipino">Filipino</span> separatists
found the friar to be the greatest obstacle to be encountered.
<span class="corr" id="xd26e3478" title=
"Source: &lsquo;">&ldquo;</span>The friar,&rdquo; wrote Governor D.
Francisco Borrero, to Sr. Canovas, in a memoir concerning the
Archipelago, &ldquo;knowing the language, spirit, and <span class=
"corr" id="xd26e3481" title="Source: tendancies">tendencies</span> of
the natives, is considered as the principal obstacle for the
realization of the filibuster idea, and hence arises their aspiration
(that of the enemies of Spain) that the Religious Orders should be
eliminated, because such a step being taken, they believe they will
have travelled half the journey&#8202;&hellip;.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The propaganda of Universal freemasonry, of <span class="corr"
title="Source: filipino">Filipino</span> freemasonry, of the Liga
Filipina, of the Compromisarios, was aimed principally at the Religious
Orders, but the results attained were but introductory to the real work
of the Katipunan, which, finding itself cornered by the discovery of
the plot it had concocted against the Government, showed its hand. Its
aim was anti-Spanish and not merely anti-friar, as is sufficiently
clear from the fact that in all the documents of the diabolical
association it is death to <i>all the Spaniards</i>, and not to this or
that class. Moreover in many cases the same <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb151" href="#pb151" name=
"pb151">151</a>]</span>Katipuneros saved their parish priests from a
sure death whilst they dealt out anything but kind treatment to those
of the Civil Guard (<span class="corr" title=
"Source: filipinos">Filipinos</span>) and the Spanish troops who fell
into their hands. The friars who were murdered by the rebels were not
murdered for being friars but because they were Spaniards. The
documents captured, the result of the trials held in judgement of
persons guilty of treason, show clearly that the revolution was for the
purpose of gaining the independence of the country from Spain, and not
merely to bring about the expulsion of the Religious Orders. Aguinaldo,
the leader of the Katipunan <span class="corr" id="xd26e3497" title=
"Source: hoardes">hordes</span>, desired to send the friars who fell
prisoners into his hands, over to <span class="corr" id="xd26e3501"
title="Source: Hong-kong">Hong-Kong</span>, where they would be at
liberty to return to their own country; but this merciful desire of his
was overruled by his advisers, among whom were numbered Mabini his
right hand man, Pardo de Tavera, Legarda and Buencamino, all three of
them traitors to the cause of independence. To-day they stand in
positions of honor, honor which they have done nothing to deserve,
whilst Aguinaldo who was the tool of political schemers, their
play-thing, is cast into disgrace and kept in the <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb152" href="#pb152" name=
"pb152">152</a>]</span>background, a scape-goat for the sins and
shortcomings of men whose names disgrace the darkest pages of
Philippine history.</p>
<p id="n27"><span class="sc">Note 27.</span> Vast numbers of these
documents were later on destroyed in the hope that certain affairs of
an anti-patriotic nature might be hushed up, and many persons of a high
official standing saved from scandal. Padre Mariano Gil, O. S. A., who
made known to the public authorities the fearful plot of the Katipunan
in time to prevent the brutal murder of hundreds of Spaniards, was
granted certified copies of a large number (all the principal ones) of
the documents and these have been since preserved with the greatest
care, and remain to-day as a standing proof of the duplicity of many
persons who live in ignorance of the fact of the existence of the said
certified copies.</p>
<p id="n28"><span class="sc">Note 28.</span> The element here spoken of

was Marcelo H. del Pilar.</p>
<p id="n30"><span class="sc">Note 30.</span> See note <a href=
"#n26">26</a>. The campaign at this present carried on by some of the
filipino and Spanish papers, and, in contradiction to the fundamental
principles of Americanism, by the local American press also, is but a
sequel to the work of this committee of propaganda. The calumnies which
are literally crammed into the columns of Manila&rsquo;s English
speaking daily and weekly press are but a poor reproduction of the
vicious publications distributed throughout the archipelago since the
year 1888. For fourteen years have these calumnies been published, but
in spite of countless challenges, never have the statements brought
forward been backed up with even the shadow of proof. When almighty God
completed his creation by the making of man and woman, he led them to
Eden, placing them under his law. Then it was that the devil beguiled
them with lying words: &ldquo;For God doth know that in that day that
you shall eat thereof <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb154" href=
"#pb154" name="pb154">154</a>]</span>(of the forbidden fruit) your eyes
shall be opened, and you shall be as Gods knowing good and evil.&rdquo;
From that day to this, this same argument that the devil used to try to
prove that God was withholding from the people what was to their
benefit, is being to-day used by certain of the offspring of that evil
spirit against the element of good, against the Religious Orders, the
servants of God, claiming that they held from the people of this
Archipelago that which was for their good and advancement. Adam and Eve
found to their bitter cost that the devil lied: those who are to-day
being misled by anti-friar calumny will make the same discovery in due
time.</p>

<p>Instead of serving to keep together the subjects and their rulers in
a bond of peace and tranquility, and helping them to come to a mutual
understanding, in which state the progress and advancement of the
islands and their inhabitants could be the easier and the better
accomplished, the separatist element, by their propaganda, caused more
and more strife by attacking national institutions and by casting slurs
upon national honor. The discontent stirred up against the Spanish
authorities was identical to that which, until the passing of the law
of sedition and even since that time, was stirred up against the
American sovereignty. In its propaganda against the Religious Orders,
inciting the native clergy against the lawful authority of their
Bishops, it was the precursor of modern Manila&rsquo;s American press.
History tells us what was the result of the lessening of the moral
influence of the Religious Orders in the days of Spanish rule, and
to-day History repeats itself. The inciting of the native clergy
against their Bishops is encouraging the natives, as a whole, to resist
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb164" href="#pb164" name=

Orders, in 1896 it had become &ldquo;death to all Spaniards&rdquo;. In
1898 the American was blessed as a deliverer from oppression, in 1899
cursed as an intruder. To-day&#8202;&hellip;? Who knows the opinion of

<p id="n39"><span class="sc">Note 39.</span> From the earliest to the

Rizal; what became of it? Funds were collected for the purchase of

<p>Pio Valenzuela in recounting the forms and ceremonies practiced upon

<p>&ldquo;Once in the house<a class="noteref" id="xd26e3999src" href=

"pagenum">[<a id="pb171" href="#pb171" name="pb171">171</a>]</span>the
association was to obtain the independence of the Philippines,
oppressed and enslaved by the Spaniards. Placing, later on, a dagger at
his breast, they obliged him to throw himself upon it, a thing which
the witness could not pluck up courage enough to do; whereupon they
placed it in his hand, leading him to a man whom he recognized to be
seated, and ordered him (the witness) to strike him with the dagger, a
thing which he dare not do either. He was then conducted into a room
and addressed by a person he knew to be Bonifacio by the voice, who
informed him that he could not retrace his steps because he knew of the
existence of the society, but he could not assist at the <i>juntas</i>
nor could they teach him the signs of recognition till he had been
re-initiated; they moreover made him sign two sheets of blank paper,
causing him to swear never to reveal the existence of the society to
anyone, under the pain of <span class="corr" id="xd26e4013" title=
"Source: asssasination">assassination</span>. They then removed the
bandage which he was blindfolded and he saw around him eight or nine
individuals dressed in cloaks and hoods; he signed the two sheets of
paper and was again blindfolded and conducted to a considerable
distance from the <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb172" href="#pb172"

removed.</p>
<p>Another member of the Katipunan in his declaration made on the 22nd
of September 1896, stated that during the month of February 1893, one
Sunday morning, a certain Estanislao Legaspi entered his store, telling
him to accompany him in a <i lang="es">calesa</i><span class="corr"
title="Source: ,">.</span> He listened to tirades against the Spanish
Government till their arrival at the house of a certain Tranquilino
Torres, in calle Elcano<span class="corr" title=

and he was handed over to the care of another individual who conducted
him to the upper story of the house and made him sit down; he then
heard a person whom he knew to be Legaspi by his voice speak, saying
several things against the Spanish Government, demanding of him an oath
of blind obedience, and a defense of the Philippines till the shedding
of the last drop of his blood, threatening him with fearful punishments
if he should turn traitor. This ceremony being terminated, his eyes
were unbound and he saw, on a table, a skull which they made him kiss,
and Legaspi handed him a lance commanding him to wound himself in the
arm; but he felt a feeling of <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb173"
href="#pb173" name="pb173">173</a>]</span>faintheartedness come over
him, and manifested to those present that he had not courage enough to
wound himself and wished that the oath he had taken be enough; he was
dispensed from the operation. When the bandage was removed the eight
individuals composing the <i lang="es">junta</i> were masked with black
hoods, but after he kissed the skull and attempted to wound himself
they removed the hoods and he then recognized Estanislao Legaspi who
presided, Mariano de Vera, Teodoro Plata and Juan de la Cruz who was a
clerk of the Tabacalera, and who had led him upstairs; he did not know
the other three. The witness paid two pesos as entrance fee promising
to pay 50 cents monthly. He asked Legaspi what association it was, and
he replied that it was the <i lang="es">Liga Filipina</i>.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Herewith is given translated most faithfully from Tagalog,

<p id="n53"><span class="sc">Note 53.</span> Rizal had money troubles
previously with Pilar in Madrid (see note 39). The excessive earnest
and zeal displayed at the time of the foundation of the <i>Liga</i> by
Rizal died away on his deportation. This zeal was owing to the
captivating manner in which the founder demonstrated to his audience
the brilliant future to be attained by such an undertaking. Rizal had
the advantage of a ready oratory and like Bonifacio, drew his hearers
to his cause in spite of themselves. And then again, the same as in
masonry, the association was secret, and its true end and aim were but
whispered; and whilst many of the associated were laboring to assist,
as they thought, in the fomentation of the <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb177" href="#pb177" name=

were in reality playing with the toy <span class="corr" id="xd26e4105"
title="Source: alloted">allotted</span> to them by the society, whilst
the chief members, those members <i>best suited to be masons</i>, as

in the lower degrees of any secret society, and of masonry in
particular, the members are unaware of what is aimed at in the degrees
to which they have not attained, to which all cannot attain, and the
secrets of which are zealously guarded, so it was in the
<i>Liga</i>.</p>
<p>Upon its re-establishment the Liga counted among its members several
who aimed at the leadership. The absence of Rizal, deported to Dapitan,
left open the door for unbridled ambition. Everyone wanted to be the
head. This together with money troubles brought about considerable ill
feeling between the absent founder and those continuing the work of the
association. Rizal <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb178" href="#pb178"
name="pb178">178</a>]</span>had so far kept up a continual secret
communication with the Liga, thanks to the liberty allowed him by his
keepers in Mindanao, who guarded him with scandalous carelessness; and
thanks also to the <span class="corr" id="xd26e4128" title=
"Source: emisaries">emissaries</span> sent to him from Manila in search
of instructions and advice. The result of the ill-feeling thus brought
about was the rupture in official relations between the <i>Liga</i> and

<p id="n54"><span class="sc">Note 54.</span> See note <a href=

<p id="n55"><span class="sc">Note 55.</span> One of the facts clearly
developed in the trials of those suspected of treason, was that the
guilty ones had taken the utmost care not to leave behind them traces
of their work. This was principally the case with Rizal and the other
chief workers of the revolt, and of those who formed the association of
<i>Compromisarios</i>.</p>
<p id="n56"><span class="sc">Note 56.</span> Both Pedro and Francisco

&hellip; (and others); and there existed in the provinces others whose
names he could not remember.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Domingo Franco y Tuason testified on the 30th of September 1896
(fols. 1332&ndash;1337) that &ldquo;in another of the several
interviews he had with Francisco L. Roxas, he asked him if in the
circle of his relations (with the association) he counted with persons

don P. Roxas and others.&rdquo;</p>
<p>When Francisco Roxas found himself in danger of arrest, he attempted
to flee to Hong-Kong, but was captured on board the ship which was to
carry him there. From the ship he was conducted under arrest to the

position to which he could never have attained without her aid, he was
found to have placed himself in the <span class="corr" id="xd26e4189"
title="Source: van-guard">vanguard</span> of the bitterest enemies of
his country. He was the director of the workings of separatism and was
the chief provider of arms for the revolt, as was testified by
innumerable witnesses.<a class="noteref" id="xd26e4192src" href=

<p>&ldquo;I, Francisco L. Roxas, on the eve of my death, in reparation
for what in my words and actions may have offended my neighbor; for
warning of others of my person and in order to satisfy my conscience,
to the end that no one, and especially my children, fall into the net
of freemasonry, or of any other secret society, all of which I detest
and curse, and be not in a day to come ungrateful sons of our Mother
Spain, beg pardon for all my faults and bad example.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I die in the Holy Roman Catholic Apostolic faith in which I
was born and educated in a christian manner. I admit all that she
admits and condemn all that she condemns.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;This I sign with my own hand with entire liberty.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Jany. 10th 1897 in Manila, Royal Fort of Santiago.&mdash;F. L.
Roxas:&mdash;Witnesses: Antonio Pardo and Felix
Garc&iacute;a<span class="corr" title="Not in source">.</span></p>
<p>On January 11th Gov. Gen. Polavieja telegraphed to Madrid as
follows:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sentenced by council of War, to-day there have been executed
(shot) twelve persons <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb182" href=
"#pb182" name="pb182">182</a>]</span>guilty of treason &hellip; among
them Francisco Roxas, Councillor of Administration; Nijaga, Lieut. of
native infantry; Villaroel, Villareal, Moises Salvador and
others.&rdquo;</p>
<hr class="tb">
<p>Pedro Roxas was also a millionaire who inherited a good fortune,
which, under the shelter of official protection multiplied
considerably. Spain honored him with the grand cross of Isabela la
Cat&oacute;lica. Like Francisco he was a Councillor of Administration.
He possessed a large estate in Nasugbu which, when the revolt broke
out, became an insurgent hornet&rsquo;s nest. There the rebels had a
cannon, three falconettes and a large number of arms.</p>
<p>After having been deprived of his office by decree previously
mentioned, Pedro Roxas secured in some way or other from Blanco,
permission to go to Spain. On arrival at Singapore he landed and
remained there. Later on he was defended in the Spanish Cort&eacute;s
by Sr. Romero Robledo<a class="noteref" id="xd26e4232src" href=
"#xd26e4232" name="xd26e4232src">31</a>. In Manila, to those who could
judge of the facts on the spot, this defence came as a thunderbolt.
However, the Spanish paper <i lang="es">El <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb183" href="#pb183" name=
"pb183">183</a>]</span>Correo</i> in the issue of August 15th said:</p>
<p>&ldquo;The conduct of Sr. Roxas results satisfactorily cleared, so
that no doubt remains in respect to his complete disconnection with the
revolt.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Among the separatist element Pedro Roxas was known as the Emperor
Pedro I.</p>
<p id="n57"><span class="sc">Note 57.</span> Maximo M. A. Paterno was
the father of the well known Pedro Paterno<span class="corr" title=
"Source: ,">.</span> Maximo was in his latter days the leading spirit
of the celebrations held in honor of the amnesty <span class="corr" id=
"xd26e4254" title="Source: proclamed">proclaimed</span> in 1900, by the
late President McKinley. He died at the age of 76, just before the
celebrations took place.</p>
<p>This amnesty celebration, like most things attempted by <span class=
"corr" title="Source: filipinos">Filipinos</span> alone, turned but a
fiasco, the speeches which were to be delivered on the occasion not
being in any way in keeping with the oath of allegiance taken by the
speakers. The speeches contemplated were in advocation of practically
the same thing as that for which the rebels had been keeping up an
armed struggle, and so, when the U. S. Commission was invited by Pedro
Paterno to be present thereat, it naturally was unable to accept the
invitation. <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb184" href="#pb184" name=
"pb184">184</a>]</span></p>
<p>The whole celebration was an abortive attempt on the part of its
organizers to antagonize the Military and Civil authorities. Mr. Taft,
as president of the Commission, at first accepted the invitation
extended, supposing the <span class="corr" id="xd26e4265" title=
"Source: speaches">speeches</span> to be given, had been censored by
the proper authorities, at that time the military; but on finding that
this was not so, he declined in the name of the other members of the
Commission, and thus avoided the <span class="corr" id="xd26e4268"
title="Source: unpleasentness">unpleasantness</span> of being present
at a banquet at which both the Military and the Civil authorities would
be insulted and the Government of the U. S. defied.</p>
<p>On the 28th of July 1900, the day of the banquet, Mr. Taft on behalf
of his fellow Commissioners, addressed a letter to Pedro Paterno on the
subject. See Appendix J.</p>
<p>Pedro Paterno was one of those who for a considerable time refused
to take the oath of allegiance; with him were others, Mabini in
particular.</p>
<p>Maximo Paterno had received from Spain the Cross of Knight of the
Royal and American Order of Isabela La Cat&oacute;lica. <span class=

<p id="n58"><span class="sc">Note 58.</span> <i>And others</i>: Among
the names mentioned in many of the documents I have consulted on the
subject of the trials of those guilty of treason, I have frequently
come across those of Linjap (Mariano), Chidian (Telesforo), Yangco
(Luis R.), and others. Of this latter Domingo Franco was asked during
his trial, if Luis R. Yangco had assisted at any reunion of the
<i lang="es">compromisarios</i>, to which he replied that he (Yangco)
had not assisted at any session (fols. 1381&ndash;1382)<span class=

<p>As I have already remarked in another note, many of those charged
with complicity in the affairs of the revolt were latter on proved to
be innocent. That considerable number of the wealthy natives and
half-castes sympathised more or less with the idea of greater
liberality in government, is undoubtedly true, but that they extended
their sympathies to the aims of the hordes of cut-throats led by
Bonifacio is absurd.</p>
<p>The leading <span class="corr" title=
"Source: filipinos">Filipinos</span> and many insular Spaniards sighed
for privileges which the Government of Madrid did not deem well to
concede. To bring pressure upon the Government some of these combined
to support in the metropolis, some of their number who <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb186" href="#pb186" name=
"pb186">186</a>]</span>should keep up the work of agitation. This
agitation however took a form displeasing to many, who thereupon ceased
to lend it their aid and consent. But few of the leaders of the people,
especially of the wealthy ones, desired to cut themselves adrift from
Spain, and not till a few insignificant beings such as Aguinaldo,
Bonifacio, Mabini, and Pilar (Pio del) and Buencamino came upon the
scene did the idea of independence of the island really take form. A
faint idea of such a thing as independence did exist formerly, but the
enlightened <span class="corr" title=
"Source: filipinos">Filipinos</span> saw, only too clearly, the
probable result.</p>
<p>The wealthy proprietors here cited, no doubt sympathised more or
less with the <i>Liga Filipina</i> in its beginning, whilst it was
under the complete control of its founder Rizal; but as the <i>Liga</i>
lost the character given to it by Rizal, and underwent the change it
did, it is only natural to suppose that many of its former supporters
left it as they would a sinking ship. However the fact that they were
identified with the original <i>Liga</i> seems to have been taken as a
proof of their connection with the revolt<span class="corr" title=
"Source: ,">.</span> This is certainly the opinion expressed by Sr.
Diaz. <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb187" href="#pb187" name=

<p id="n59"><span class="sc">Note 59.</span> Mactan is the name of the
island upon which Magallanes, the famous explorer, met his death at the
hands of the savage <span class="corr" id="xd26e4326" title=

island peopled by savages at the time of its chief notoriety, and
Mayon, the site of a destructive volcano, are very suitable names to
give to such centers as were the popular councils of Trozo and Sta.
Cruz.</p>
<p id="n60"><span class="sc">Note 60.</span> On the 30th of August
1895, the Civil Governor of Batangas asked of the commander of the

follows:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Among the group of the chief ones and as chief of them,
stands Felipe Agoncillo, <span class="corr" id="xd26e4350" title=
"Source: propritetor">proprietor</span> and lawyer<span class="corr"
title="Not in source">.</span>&rdquo; He then goes on to explain how
Agoncillo imposed his will upon <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb188"
href="#pb188" name="pb188">188</a>]</span>every one in the pueblo, even
upon the Municipality, no law or regulation sent even by the highest
authorities going into force until it had been passed upon by him.
&ldquo;It would be difficult,&rdquo; says he, &ldquo;for me to collect
any perfect proof of his anti-Spanish tendencies which are, however,
self-evident to the Spanish element of this province<span class="corr"
id="xd26e4358" title="Source: &rdquo;.">.&rdquo;</span> This report,
which was a sufficient <span class="corr" id="xd26e4361" title=
"Source: warningof">warning of</span> danger, was sent to the Gov. of
Batangas on the 18th of September 1895. He immediately forwarded it to
Gen. Blanco. About three months afterwards Blanco looked into the
matter, circumstances demanding that some steps should be taken to
preserve national honor; and he decided to deport six of the
<span class="corr" id="xd26e4365" title=
"Source: seperatists">separatists</span> as an example to the
remainder. Of these six one was Agoncillo. This industrious filibuster
had influential and <span class="corr" id="xd26e4368" title=
"Source: watchfull">watchful</span> friends in Manila, who, upon seeing
the turn things were taking, telegraphed him &ldquo;<span lang=
"es">Caf&eacute; en baja; fuera existencias.</span>&rdquo; This was
warning sufficient and Agoncillo accompanied by Ramon Atienza succeeded
in escaping.</p>
<p>On the 14th of April the Japanese Mail Steamer Hiorine left Manila.
On this steamer Agoncillo fled, hidden it is said, in a coal
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb189" href="#pb189" name=
"pb189">189</a>]</span>bunk. The <i lang="es">Heraldo de Madrid</i> of
the 16th of September 1896, in speaking of the affair says:
&ldquo;Agoncillo gave the captain of the ship the sum of 350 pesos as
gratification and on this account had placed at his disposal upon
arrival at Kobe, a ship&rsquo;s boat, whilst the remaining passengers
had to hire their transportation.&rdquo;</p>
<p>On the 2nd of May 1896, the secret police of Manila reported to Gen.
Blanco, as follows:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Notice is hereby given of the sailing for Japan of Felipe
Agoncillo, property-owner of the province of Batangas, who goes to put
himself at the disposition of the junta magna (in Japan), carrying with
him some 80,000 pesos collected in Lipa, Taal and other pueblos, for
the sustainment of anti-Spanish propaganda.<span class="corr" id=
"xd26e4385" title="Not in source">&rdquo;</span></p>
<p>Like most of the leaders of the separatist campaign, Agoncillo was
astute. He partook of that peculiar trait of the native character: a
sharpness of perception, a cuteness which one not acquainted with the
indian would take for intelligence. An <span class="corr" id=
"xd26e4391" title="Source: indian">Indian</span> will often do
something remarkable, but in spite of its appearance of being an
extraordinary action, a result of a well thought <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb190" href="#pb190" name="pb190">190</a>]</span>out
plan, it proceeds in ninety-nine cases out of a hundred, from instinct
rather from intelligence. Native peoples are more accustomed to use
their common-sense than most of us and hence arises the fact, that
frequently the <span class="corr" title=
"Source: filipino">Filipino</span> has <span class="corr" id=
"xd26e4399" title="Source: autwitted">outwitted</span> both the
military and the civil <span class="corr" id="xd26e4402" title=

in dealing with the Oriental in India, Spain learned it here, and
America has yet to discover the same truth.</p>
<p>Mr. Wildman<a class="noteref" id="xd26e4407src" href="#xd26e4407"
name="xd26e4407src">32</a>, the late U. S. Consul at Hong-Kong, once
affirmed of Agoncillo, &ldquo;Sr. Agoncillo is a very intelligent and
daring diplomat (the Government later on found him to be far more
daring than intelligent), and could fill the position of chief of any
department of State in any civilized country.&rdquo; But then, it was
nothing strange for Wildman to make such breaks! <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb191" href="#pb191" name="pb191">191</a>]</span></p>
<p id="n61"><span class="sc">Note 61.</span> Among these honorable
exceptions which Sr. Diaz says he has great pleasure in recognizing,
might be mentioned several who were <span class="corr" id="xd26e4447"
title="Source: falsly">falsely</span> accused and whose names have gone
down to the reading public in the works of various writers who wrote in
good faith, branded with the mark of ingratitude which characterized
and still characterizes so many natives and half-castes.</p>
<p>It gives a careful student of the subject more than passing pleasure
to be able to give the lie to those who in their testimony classified
as members of the infernal plot to &ldquo;cut the throats of every
Spaniard, without regard even to parentage&rdquo;, the names
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb192" href="#pb192" name=
"pb192">192</a>]</span>of some of the most prominent <span class="corr"
title="Source: filipinos">Filipinos</span> of to-day, men who although
they have not grovelled in the dust before the <span class="corr" id=
"xd26e4457" title="Source: conquerer">conqueror</span> and accepted
positions under the new Government, are more truly prominent than those
who assert themselves as the &ldquo;leaders&rdquo; of the people.</p>
<p>Among these honorable exceptions there were many who although they
came to form part of the so-called Revolutionary Government, did so
only when Spanish rule had ceased to exist, and when the accepted
opinion was that a government elected by the people would be recognized
by the U. S. These, however, were never traitors to the mother country;
they were men who treated Spain as every honorable man should treat his
country. These were not men who changed their religion as they changed
their clothes: to suit the occasion. They were not men who concealed
their titles to freemason degrees, at the bottom of their trunks, and
exposed them with pride upon the change of sovereignty. These men were
never perjurers, never traitors. Born and raised in the bosom of the
Catholic faith they remained faithful to it, and faithful to the
traditions of the country which gave <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"pb193" href="#pb193" name="pb193">193</a>]</span>them their political
being; and it is with great pleasure that, with Sr. Diaz, I also can
say, that I have great pleasure in recognizing these honorable
exceptions, and in proof thereof have I dedicated this small historical
sketch to them.</p>
<p id="n62"><span class="sc">Note 62.</span> Day by day the morality in
the administration of the funds became worse, and so intense did the
ill-feeling engendered by pride become, that the members forgot all
about the fomentation of the culture and advancement of the country.
Like a nursery full of <span class="corr" id="xd26e4468" title=
"Source: wilful">willful</span> children, they all wanted their own
way, and when they could not have it, some cried: &ldquo;now I

perhaps was the chief cause of the dissolution of the association, for
some did go and tell &ldquo;ma;&rdquo; and the wealthy members, and
those who had anything to lose, were immediately overcome with abject
fear lest &ldquo;ma&rdquo; should punish them with a good spanking.</p>
<p>&ldquo;In the month of October 1893, the Superior Council becoming
aware that some documents pertaining, to the <i lang="es">Liga</i> had
been handed over to the offices of the General Government, the
dissolution of the society <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb194" href=

<p>On the 25th of May 1896, notice was given by the secret police to

<p>&ldquo;Notice is herewith given of the existence in Manila, of a

affiliated a large number of individuals&#8202;&hellip;.&rdquo;</p>
<p id="n63"><span class="sc">Note 63.</span> The testimony given by
many of the political prisoners as to the foundation, aims and work of
the <i>Compromisarios</i> is somewhat conflicting. For instance:
Antonio Salazar, (fols. <span class="corr" id="xd26e4506" title=

mal-administration of the funds, &ldquo;the subscription on behalf of

follow names of members), and seeing that they could not gather
sufficient funds, they agreed to increase the subscription and seek
persons to associate with them.&rdquo;</p>
<p>On another occasion the same witness testified (fols. <span class=

with Marcelo <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb195" href="#pb195" name=

him.&rdquo; He also stated that &ldquo;on account of the bad conduct
observed in Madrid by Pilar, &hellip; some of the <i lang=

<p>In reply to a question as to the relationship between the <i lang=

opinion, that &ldquo;there could be no doubt that both societies aimed
at the same end.&rdquo; At fols. 1118&ndash;1129 the same witness
affirmed that &ldquo;as the partisans of Rizal and Pilar &hellip; saw
that neither masonry nor the <i>Liga</i> could hope for funds<a class=

<p>Domingo Franco affirmed that the outbreak of the revolt came as a
great surprise to the <i>Compromisarios</i>.</p>
<p>As to the aims of the society, Mois&eacute;s Salvador y Francisco is
authority for the statement that: <span class="corr" id="xd26e4567"

pervade the minds of the so-called progressive <span class="corr"
title="Source: filipinos">Filipinos</span> was that with a code of laws
<i>&aacute; la Europea</i>, the adoption of some or other new fangled
idea imported from France, Germany or anywhere but the Peninsular, the
<span class="corr" title="Source: filipino">Filipino</span> would
immediately attain the advancement and culture enjoyed among the
Japanese. To anyone not acquainted with either the <span class="corr"
title="Source: filipino">Filipino</span> or the Japanese, such an idea
might be acceptable; but no student of Oriental races, nor even the
mere <span class="corr" id="xd26e4743" title=

venture to predict than even with all the advantages of modernism the
<span class="corr" title="Source: filipino">Filipino</span> now enjoys,
will he, as a people, attain to such a state of culture as that enjoyed
by the sons of the Empire of the Rising Sun even in a hundred
years.</p>
<p>Among the European peoples the progress of civilization and
regeneration was slow but it was none the less decisive. Among
Orientals it is, as a rule, quick but not lasting. Among almost all
Oriental peoples <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb199" href="#pb199"
name="pb199">199</a>]</span>the rising generation is bright and gives
signs of great possibilities; but these youths after having passed with
honors through college and university, too often end their lives as
they began them&mdash;as children. What the Oriental lacks is
stability. Nothing is more common in the Philippines than to find that
your cook or coachman has completed four-fifths of his studies as
lawyer, doctor or something else. The <span class="corr" title=
"Source: filipino">Filipino</span> who has reached the age of thirty
and has not, in these days, been <i lang="tl">bata</i><a class=
"noteref" id="xd26e4759src" href="#xd26e4759" name=

<i>cochero</i>, cook, collector of accounts for some business house,
letter-carrier, postman, policeman, musician in a church choir,
fireman, and connected with a few other employments of more or less
importance, is by no means a <i lang="la">rara avis</i>, to say nothing
of the many who have also been majors and generals in the insurgent
&ldquo;army&rdquo;, and without stopping to consider a pair of very
prominent natives who from <i>batas</i> in the University of Sto.
Tom&aacute;s <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb200" href="#pb200" name=
"pb200">200</a>]</span>have, after a series of political intrigues,
risen to positions of <i>law-tinkers</i> over a people, the vast
majority of whom hate and despise them.</p>
<p>As a matter of fact the very best of the filipino politicians and
other local men of <i>fame</i>, bright, learned and progressive though
they be, would count but little side by side with the foremost sons of
the Flowery Kingdom. To find in Yokohama, or even in Nagasaki or Kobe,
or any other city of Japan, a hundred Rizals, a hundred Pilars
(Marcelos, Pios or Gregorios), a hundred Apacibles, or Mabinis, or
Aguinaldos, or Buencaminos or Taveras would be an easy task. But to
find in the Philippines a Marquis Ito, a Mutsu, a Yamata or a
Matsugata,&mdash;that is the question.</p>
<p>And why? Because at the time when Spain discovered these islands,
finding the people in a state of social and moral degradation, without
formal government or any social organization beyond the <span class=
"corr" id="xd26e4790" title="Source: tribual">tribal</span> system (and
that but limited) common to almost all savage peoples, the Japanese had
already counted with more than 1000 years of more or less stable
government, always organized, and with a social organization
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb201" href="#pb201" name=
"pb201">201</a>]</span>and a firm national unity. The people of Japan,
at that time, cultivated the arts and sciences, enjoyed the fruits of
prosperous industries and of external commerce. They had a religion and
a language which could be written and understood when written.

history of the workings of separatism in the Philippines, proof were
wanting of the cruel deceit practiced by the filibuster leaders upon
the ignorants who formed the mass of the secret associations of masonic

the whole question of the part played by Japan or by individual
Japanese in the separatist movement from beginning to end I am strongly
of the opinion that the supposed assistance, whether in the form of
arms and ammunition, or in that of financial or moral support was a
deliberate imposture, and that those credulous persons who contributed
with their hard-earned money towards the sums said to have been
utilized for propaganda in Japan, were defrauded, not only out of the
money they gave to the funds, but also of what they might legitimately
hope for as a result of the expenditure of the said funds. It is a well

<p>&ldquo;According to what is said, Ramos interviewed, on several

who was then a minister. These gentlemen, it seems, were sympathizers
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb210" href="#pb210" name=

gaining it, the fomentation of Japanese immigration in the Philippines,
and that when once this was attained, the seeking of a conflict with
Spain.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Further on he states that: &ldquo;Some days before the insurrection
broke out, <span class="corr" id="xd26e5084" title=

Jos&eacute; A. Ramos, in which he gave me an account of the efforts

the end that they should aid us to secure our independence. Artacho
told me verbally the details and that he knew that the liberal party of
Japan, which then was the opposition, sympathized with the idea, and
proposed as a means of attaining it, the seeking of a cause of conflict
with Spain, introducing Japanese emigrants to that end.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mois&eacute;s Salvador (fols. <span class="corr" id="xd26e5089"

to letters received by Bonifacio Ar&eacute;valo from Cort&eacute;s and

minister asked them what money they <span class="pagenum">[<a id=

send them arms in June or July, to the coast of Luzon, to be
disembarked near the island of Polillo&#8202;&hellip;.&rdquo;</p>
<p>That the separatists hoped for, and aimed to secure the aid of Japan
is certain; many testified to the fact; but this testimony was more or
less hearsay. Certain leading <span class="corr" id="xd26e5107" title=

scheme and were, no doubt, listened to by some more or less prominent
persons. This is all the more probable when we remember that the
credentials carried by the Commission took the form of a petition

<p>The work of propaganda carried on by certain <span class="corr"

country, and enjoy its beautiful climate. Later on they directed a
letter to the Commander, Jacinto drawing it up and Bonifacio, Dizon and
himself and others signing it; its text was a salutation to the Emperor

invited to the &ldquo;Bazar Japon&eacute;s,&rdquo; to salute and

arrived an officer of the ship who said he was the doctor, and soon
after the commander arrived; all saluted him&#8202;&hellip;. On the
evening of the same day Bonifacio, Valenzuela and the witness went to
Nagtajan to the house where lived the Japanese who kept the
<i>Bazar</i>&hellip;. Bonifacio told them they had a letter to give
them. Three or four days later on, Valenzuela presented himself at the
house of the witness with a letter in Tagalo which read more or less as
follows: (here follows what the witness remembered of the letter.)
Bonifacio signed it as president of the Supreme Council of the

taken a copy of it, returning <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb215"

persons signing it were not representative; but that the said officer
was very pleased with the pictures given in the name of the
<i>Katipunan</i>, and with the melons and mangoes sent from
Cavite.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Isabelo de los Reyes affirms that: &ldquo;When the Japanese cruiser
<i>Kongo</i> visited the port of Manila in May 1896, the Supreme
Council of the <i>Katipunan</i> went to salute its commander in the
upstairs of the <i lang="es">Bazar Japon&eacute;s</i>, situated in the
<i lang="es">plaza</i> del Padre Moraga, and handed him a manuscript
setting forth their desire for the aid and assistance of Japan towards
the gaining of independence for the Philippines. They also offered him
a picture and some native fruits.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The commander received them well and even regaled them with
iced drinks and coffee, but did not dare to accept the document,
limiting himself to the taking of a copy of it and promising to
transmit their desires to the Emperor; he also invited them to make a
voyage to his country. Nothing has since been heard of the
commander.&rdquo;</p>
<p>So much for the testimony given concerning the <i>Kongo</i> and its
commander.</p>
<p>Information I have obtained from Japanese <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb216" href="#pb216" name=

the <i>Kongo</i> steamed into Manila bay in 1896 in the same manner as
it did recently, on a non-official visit. As was customary, the
Japanese Commander and other officers visited the Japanese Bazaar in
Plaza Moraga as well as other Japanese business houses. The <i lang=

commander accepted; the petition he did not accept: in this he showed
good sense. As to the supposed copy which he promised to take, evidence
goes to show that it was not taken, but that the said commander merely
made a few notes of it on a scrap of paper. The proprietors of the
<i lang="es">Bazar</i> ridicule the idea that the commander favored the
petition or received the so-called commission with pleasure; their
opinion is that to which any investigator of the affair would come,
that the Commander was a gentleman and did not wish to hurt the
feelings, by his refusal, of even such <i lang="es">ignorantes</i> as
those who <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb217" href="#pb217" name=
"pb217">217</a>]</span>at that time forced themselves upon him.</p>
<p id="n70"><span class="sc">Note 70.</span> The idea that the
<i>Liga</i> was but an introduction to the <i>Katipunan</i> is not
borne out by the facts of the case. The <i>Liga Filipina</i> was a
foundation of Rizal, whilst the Katipunan was a conception of Pilar
who, finding Rizal was carrying all before him, determined not to be
<span class="corr" id="xd26e5253" title=
"Source: outdone">out-done</span> by his former companion. The very
fact of the enmity existing between the two leaders is proof enough
that the two societies were not one and the same thing, although after
their foundation they walked arm in arm. The <i>Liga</i>, as an
association, was eventually dissolved, and from <span class="corr" id=
"xd26e5260" title="Source: it it">it</span> was formed the
<i>Compromisarios</i> (see note <a href="#n63">63</a>) and this body
continued its functions till the outbreak of the revolt. The
vicissitudes of the <i>Liga</i> did not lessen Rizal&rsquo;s influence.
Ever ready to tell a lie or act one if it were to his own advantage,
Rizal permitted the free use of his name in connection with the
<i>Katipunan</i> also. To the vast majority of the <i>oath-bound</i>,
the <i>Katipunan</i> was but the <i>Liga</i> under another form; and in
order that the people should not know of the rivalry existing between
himself and Pilar, Rizal <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb218" href=
"#pb218" name="pb218">218</a>]</span>gave no signs of disfavor towards
the foundation of the new society; in fact he rather favored it, seeing
that under the circumstances it would make him figure as its
&ldquo;hero,&rdquo; and he would thus be enabled to take the wind out
of Pilar&rsquo;s sails. The only objection raised by Rizal to the work
of the <i>Katipunan</i>, was that which he made to Valenzuela: that the
time had not yet come for armed rebellion.</p>
<p>As long as he held supreme influence Rizal was satisfied; but as the
<span class="corr" id="xd26e5292" title=
"Source: seperatist">separatist</span> element was becoming weary at
the long absence of its &ldquo;Moses&rdquo; and had begun to worship
the &ldquo;calf&rdquo; (not a golden one, by the way)
&ldquo;Moses&rdquo; got angry and threw down, in disgust, the
&ldquo;tables of the law.&rdquo;</p>
<p>In its beginning, Rizal was the idol of the <i>Katipunan</i>, in the
same way as Morayta (note <a href="#n13">13</a>) was the idol of the
rebellious <span class="corr" title=
"Source: filipinos">Filipinos</span> in Madrid, and others parts of the
Peninsular. Isabelo de los Reyes<a class="noteref" id="xd26e5306src"
href="#xd26e5306" name="xd26e5306src">46</a> would have us believe that
the foundation of the <i>Katipunan</i> was a result of the indignation
of the people, consequent upon the deportation of Rizal. This, in the
face <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb219" href="#pb219" name=
"pb219">219</a>]</span>of facts, is a very poor argument and
demonstrates either the ignorance or the bad faith of Reyes. And he
himself contradicts it a few lines further on by saying &ldquo;that
without knowing Rizal, the <i>Katipunan</i> acclaimed him its honorary
President.&rdquo; This latter they certainly did but not &ldquo;without
knowing&rdquo; him. They did<a id="xd26e5318" name="xd26e5318"></a> so
because they knew nothing of his disagreement with Pilar, the real
founder of their society, and because the aim of the two societies was
practically one.</p>
<p id="n71"><span class="sc">Note 71.</span> The similarity of
character between the <i>Liga</i> and the <i>Katipunan</i> has always
been a matter of discussion. Some writers would draw a hard and fast
line between the two, considering them as oil and water, two bodies
enemies one of the other; others looking upon them as two oils, the one
vegetable and the other mineral which, although differing in nature,
mix together thoroughly.</p>
<p>Reyes, in his oft-quoted &ldquo;Memoria&rdquo; to the then Gov.
General, Primo de Rivera, in a mad attempt to prove that the
insurrection was owing to the &ldquo;friars&rdquo; and that they
attempted to invent the <i>Katipunan</i> plot to cover up their
treason, says: <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb220" href="#pb220" name=
"pb220">220</a>]</span></p>
<p>&ldquo;Above all, the friars committed the criminal and suicidal
infamy of calumniously including in the <i>Katipunan</i> the
<span class="corr" id="xd26e5341" title=
"Source: millonaire">millionaire</span> and aristocratic element, and
the middle classes, the fact being that they had nothing in common with
the <span class="corr" id="xd26e5344" title=
"Source: plebian">plebeian</span> association which they not only
despised for its low condition, but which the few who knew of its
existence must have hated, if not for egotism, for the socialistic
<span class="corr" id="xd26e5347" title=
"Source: tendancies">tendencies</span> of the said group.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Such assertions <span class="corr" id="xd26e5352" title=
"Source: searcely">scarcely</span> deserve comment, for from beginning
to end, the proceedings against the separatists were in the hands of
the civil authorities, the members of the Religious Orders having no
influence whatever in the matter, although it was they who, by their
watchfulness over the interests of the country had detected symptoms
which they, as true patriots, made known to the civil authorities. True
it is also that a friar, Padre Mariano Gil, made known, at a critical
moment, the plot of the diabolical society, in time to prevent the
bloodthirsty fiends rising in a night and cutting the throats of those
who had been their benefactors; but the &ldquo;friar&rdquo; was never a
secret service agent of the Government. <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"pb221" href="#pb221" name="pb221">221</a>]</span>What he did was what
every patriotic Spaniard would have done under the circumstances. It
was the civil authorities who, upon the discovery of the plot, caused
the arrest of those complicated, and who tried and passed judgement
upon the guilty. If millionaires and others were counted among the
members of the <i>Katipunan</i> it was because they were guilty of the
same treason as the <i>katipuneros</i> and not because they were
&ldquo;included&rdquo; by the &ldquo;friar&rdquo;.</p>

<p>So says Isabelo de los Reyes, the founder of the late <span class=

the Workman&rsquo;s Democratic Union, the most socialist movement in
the history of the Philippines. So much for the <i>Liberty</i>,

<p>Another writer, C. de Valdez, a <span lang="fr">nom-de-plume</span>
under which I recognize as hidden one whose knowledge on this subject
was very extensive, who for the study of the <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb222" href="#pb222" name=
"pb222">222</a>]</span>question had at his disposition innumerable
documents of vital importance, gives as his opinion: &ldquo;It has been
said that the <i>Liga</i> was a society into the which there entered
only elements of a certain culture, and the people of money; whilst the
<i>Katipunan</i> was formed for the poor and laboring classes. If by
this it <span class="corr" id="xd26e5400" title="Source: it">is</span>
<span class="corr" id="xd26e5404" title=
"Source: intented">intended</span> to signify that they were two close
societies, the one which should comprehend what we might call the
aristocracy and the other the common people, we cannot agree with the
opinion, because it is in contradiction with the facts. There existed a
free communication between both societies and the prominent personages
of the <i>Liga</i> mixed with the humble ones of the <i>Katipunan</i>,
taking active part in the labors and forming part of the reunions and
assemblies<a class="noteref" id="xd26e5413src" href="#xd26e5413" name=
"xd26e5413src">47</a>; <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb223" href=
"#pb223" name="pb223">223</a>]</span>in the same way the individuals of
common class entered the files of the <i>Liga</i> without any
distinction of class being drawn between them.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The writer goes on to show that the three main things needed for the
Revolution were 1st: an active propaganda of <span class="corr" id=
"xd26e5432" title="Source: seperatist">separatist</span> ideas; 2nd:
funds to cover expenses and to purchase arms, and 3rd: a considerable
number of persons ready to take up arms in the field. The first two of
these main things were to be attended to by the <i>Liga</i> and the
third by the <i>Katipunan</i>.</p>
<p>&ldquo;In the greatest utility in attaining the ultimate end of the
initiators and directors of the conspiracy, must <span class="corr" id=
"xd26e5443" title="Source: he">be</span> <span class="corr" id=
"xd26e5446" title="Source: saught">sought</span> the distinction
between the <i>Liga</i> and the <i>Katipunan</i>, and the difference
which the one or the other society enjoyed.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;In all other things, both societies, or both <span class=
"corr" id="xd26e5458" title="Source: organisims">organisms</span> of
the same society, co-exist, and display their activity jointly, the
campaign of the <i>Katipunan</i> or that of the <i>Liga</i> being the
most active; according as the necessities with which the one or the
other were preferentially encharged to satisfy the final triumph of the
revolt, might be of the greatest urgency or immediate utility.&rdquo;
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb224" href="#pb224" name=
"pb224">224</a>]</span></p>
<p>The fact is that the <i>Liga</i> and the <i>Katipunan</i> were the
distinct foundations of two personal enemies, both of whom wished to
hold for himself the position of supreme chief of the movement. (See
note <a href="#n70">70</a>).</p>
<p>D. Manuel Luengo, Civil Governor of Manila, in a report to the
Minister of Foreign affairs, speaking on the subject of the Katipunan,
says:</p>
<p>&ldquo;To carry to a head their fearful and criminal idea, they
found it necessary to recruit many people of all classes and from all
the provinces, seeking a useful means to facilitate the conjuration.
And the indian being by reason of his ignorance and his barbarianism,
like all peoples of his kind, easily fanaticised, they set to work to
fanaticise the masses, these hordes of childish people, these ignorant
laborers; and they fanaticised them by means of the <i lang=
"es">pacto-de-sangre</i>, making them swear war to the death to
Spaniards, practicing an incision in the left arm, and with the blood
which flowed from the wound made them sign their frightful
oath.&rdquo;</p>

hand of a criminal indian, whilst with the other hand a dagger was
plunged into the throat, evidenced, in a notorious manner, that this

<p id="n72"><span class="sc">Note 72.</span> Deodato Arellano,
Bonifacio, Dina and Plata, it will be remembered, were energetic
workers of the <i>Liga</i>. They had entered into the scheme of
Rizal&rsquo;s association before Pilar&rsquo;s idea of a similar
society had become known. Two months or so after the foundation of the
<i>Liga</i>, at the time when its founder was deported to Dapitan, it
was decided to take up Pilar&rsquo;s project and see what could be done
towards carrying it to a successful issue.</p>
<p>Jos&eacute; Dizon y Matanza (<span class="corr" id="xd26e5517"
title="Source: fol.">fols.</span> 1,129&ndash;<span class="corr" id=

&ldquo;on the same day in which General Despujols ordered the
publication in the <i lang="es">Gaceta</i> of the deportation of Rizal,
there gathered in a house in calle Ilaya, Bonifacio, Arellano, Valentin
Diaz, Teodoro Plata, Dina and the witness; and they agreed to form a
society to be known as the <i>Katipunan</i>, the object and ends of
which were to be filibusterism, or, in other words, the <span class=

six persons present immediately proceeded to perform upon themselves
the incision of the <i lang="es">pacto-de-sangre</i>, signing with
their own blood a blank paper, placing after the signature, the
symbolic name each chose for himself. They then drew up the
<span class="corr" id="xd26e5535" title=
"Source: programe">programme</span> of the Society. This <span class=
"corr" id="xd26e5538" title="Source: programe">programme</span> was
composed of 6 articles, viz<span class="corr" title=
"Not in source">.</span>: 1st: to constitute a secret society known as
the <i>Katipunan</i>; 2nd: that the organization was to be by
triangles, to the end that no more than three members should know one
another; 3rd: that the initiated should pay <i>one real</i> entrance
fee, and a <i>half real</i> as a monthly subscription; 4th: that as the
number of the members increased they should found one or more <i lang=
"tl">balang&#771;ay</i> in each district; 5th: to try to gather funds
to carry out the purposes of the society; 6th: that when the
opportunity occurred they should reform these articles.</p>
<p>They also agreed upon the form of oath which should be taken by the
initiated, which was to promise to shed even the last drop of blood for
the liberty of the Philippines.<a id="xd26e5559" name=
"xd26e5559"></a></p>
<p>The Katipunan was founded upon masonic usage adapted to the
character of the association. <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb227"
href="#pb227" name="pb227">227</a>]</span>Its formation was one of
triangles, each new <i>Katipunero</i> being bound to attract to the
association, two others to occupy the opposite angles. This formation
was eventually changed on account of the extent to which the society
extended, <span class="corr" id="xd26e5568" title=
"Source: it">its</span> management becoming very difficult. The
particular triangles were broken up and the association formed in three
degrees. The first degree was composed of the recently initiated
members. These each possessed a mask and some form of arm, either
fire-arm or bolo, the cost of which was borne by the member possessing
it. The members who enjoyed the second degree also possessed masks and
wore as a regalia a ribbon to which was attached a medal bearing a
letter (equivalent to K) of the old-time form of script of the
pre-Spanish filipino; also a sword and <span class="corr" id=
"xd26e5571" title="Source: bannar">banner</span> crossed.</p>
<p>The third degree members possessed red masks, the color being
distinctive of the degree, in the same way as the color of the second
degree was green, and that of first, black. These colors were symbolic:
green signified hope, and red, war. Black was but a general color
common to bandits all the world over. The masks of the third degree
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb228" href="#pb228" name=
"pb228">228</a>]</span>bore a triangle with three K&rsquo;s in the
upper part, in the ancient <span class="corr" title=
"Source: filipino">Filipino</span> script, and at the base the letters
Z&there4; Ll&there4; B&there4; (see at commencement of book). The
inferior inscription signified &ldquo;sons of the people.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Each degree had its pass words and the members only knew those of
their own degree.</p>
<p>This was the latter form of the <i>Katipunan</i> in which it
differed somewhat from the <i>Liga</i>.</p>
<p>Pilar&rsquo;s plan was <span class="corr" id="xd26e5594" title=
"Source: revolutionanary">revolutionary</span>; Bonifacio&rsquo;s truly
anarchistic.</p>
<p>Among the &ldquo;chosen people&rdquo; who testified before the
Schurman Commission were two of the three native members of the present
U. S. Commission, Tavera and Legarda. Both of these, among many other
statements which will not hold water, had something to say on the
subject of the <i>Katipunan</i>.</p>
<p>Legarda stated that: (see Report of the Philippine Commission, 1900;
vol. II page 377.<span class="corr" id="xd26e5604" title=
"Not in source">)</span></p>
<p>&ldquo;This Society of <span class="corr" title=
"Source: filipinos">Filipinos</span> (the separatist element) united
itself to the masonic society in Spain, and they established branches
here; and this masonic society which was a true masonic society with
all the characteristics <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb229" href=
"#pb229" name="pb229">229</a>]</span>of Masonry, converted itself
afterwards into the <i>Katipunan</i> society. This society, the
<i>Katipunan</i>, made great progress here in the Philippines, for they
had to <span class="corr" id="xd26e5620" title=
"Source: do do">do</span> greatly with the common people; they never
had anything to do, or mixed at at all, with the higher class of people
here in the Philippines<a class="noteref" id="xd26e5624src" href=
"#xd26e5624" name="xd26e5624src">49</a>. As a result of this the
society gained much credit and power, and undermined the forces which
were in existence, especially the native regiments of Tagalogs. This
was in 1896; the Revolution broke out at San Juan del Monte in August.
A curious fact that must be noted was that a friar, who was the priest
of Tondo, was the cause of its breaking out; for Gen. Blanco knew of
this movement of the people and what was going on<a class="noteref" id=
"xd26e5630src" href="#xd26e5630" name="xd26e5630src">50</a>, and was in
favor of making concessions to the people. This friar denounced the
society, for he had a very intimate friend <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb230" href="#pb230" name="pb230">230</a>]</span>who
was a filipino, and he caused this friend to be introduced into the
<i>Katipunan</i> society<a class="noteref" id="xd26e5641src" href=
"#xd26e5641" name="xd26e5641src">51</a>, and this friend afterwards
became the leader of the revolution himself. This <span class="corr"
title="Source: filipino">Filipino</span> was named Andr&eacute;s
Bonifacio, and later on he was chief of the revolution and chief of the
<i>Katipunan</i> society. He took refuge in Cavite, and all that
province rose up. Aguinaldo who was Municipal Captain in Cavite Viejo
that time, was also a member of the <i>Katipunan</i>. When he heard
that the <span class="corr" id="xd26e5657" title=
"Source: civil">Civil</span> Guard was going to arrest him, he revolted
too. He met a man who was his superior in the society&mdash;that is,
Bonifacio&mdash;and as his ambition was his moving spirit, he caused
Bonifacio to be shot.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Tavera gave his opinion as follows: (see same Report, page 399. Vol
II).</p>
<p>&ldquo;The conviction was strong among the Filipinos that they would
not succeed in attaining anything by any other means than force. This
being the case, the idea occurred to some <span class="corr" title=
"Source: filipinos">Filipinos</span> to found a system of <span class=
"corr" id="xd26e5667" title="Source: masony">masonry</span> here. There
were some lodges of the masonic order here, and the idea presented
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb231" href="#pb231" name=
"pb231">231</a>]</span>itself to form a sort of political masonry,
which was created and called the <i>Katipunan</i>. This Katipunan
society was naturally a secret society and had, I think, about 400,000
members, principally in the Tagalog provinces and of the people of the
valley of the Pasig River. I think in Manila and in the valley of the
Pasig there were 80,000, naturally, as there were so many, and as they
were so strong, the idea of a revolution was a natural consequence. The
principal agitator of all this movement was a man named Andr&eacute;s
Bonifacio, who stirred up and directed it. The political movement in
the Philippines was started, as was natural, by the aristocracy of
wealth and of intelligence, but the <i>Katipunan</i> society was formed
entirely of the elements from the lowest class of society. Bonifacio
was a man without education. He was employed in one of the business
houses at a small salary, of perhaps $30 or $40 (<span class="corr" id=
"xd26e5679" title="Source: mexican">Mexican</span>) a month. They went
on arranging their affairs very quietly and very secretly, awaiting a
proper moment for action, which they believed would be the time of
General Blanco&rsquo;s departure from the Philippines. Gen. Blanco was
a man who was well thought <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb232" href=
"#pb232" name="pb232">232</a>]</span>of here<a class="noteref" id=
"xd26e5684src" href="#xd26e5684" name="xd26e5684src">52</a>, for he had
a great deal of tolerance for the people<a class="noteref" id=
"xd26e5687src" href="#xd26e5687" name="xd26e5687src">53</a>. He did
tolerate masonry, and they believed that he also tolerated the
existence of the Katipunan society. One day the priest of Tondo, Padre
Gil, through the confession of a woman<a class="noteref" id=
"xd26e5695src" href="#xd26e5695" name="xd26e5695src">54</a>, learned of
the existence of the <i>Katipunan</i> society, for the woman&rsquo;s
husband was a member<a class="noteref" id="xd26e5710src" href=
"#xd26e5710" name="xd26e5710src">55</a>. This Father Gil informed the
General, so the <i>Katipunan</i> society was discovered.</p>
<p>As the reader can easily see for himself there is considerable
difference between the statements of these two persons; a comparison of
these with the real facts of the case will <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb233" href="#pb233" name="pb233">233</a>]</span>show
how easy it is for a certain element to distort truth when it serves
its purpose. I have quoted these two &ldquo;chosen&rdquo; people, not
that their statements may go down to posterity as <i>history</i> (which
has been distorted sufficiently), but because both Tavera and Legarda
formed part of Aguinaldo&rsquo;s mock government&mdash;the Filipino
Commune; and therefore both of them had plenty of occasion to know the
real facts of the case, facts they evidently desired, for some reason,
to distort.</p>
<p id="n73"><span class="sc">Note 73.</span> See notes <a href=
"#n70">70</a> and <a href="#n71">71</a>.</p>
<p id="n74"><span class="sc">Note 74.</span> Herein the
<i>katipuneros</i> showed their madness. So fanaticised did they become
that nothing of a nature or character Spanish was allowed to remain.
They carried this anti-Espa&ntilde;olism to the utmost
extreme<span class="corr" title="Not in source">.</span> Those of the
native clergy who sympathised with the <i>Katipunan</i> frequently tore
down the images of the saints in the churches, merely because the said
saints were Spanish or painted them black in order to work the easier
upon the imagination of the people.</p>
<p>It was this hatred for things Spanish that <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb234" href="#pb234" name="pb234">234</a>]</span>gave
rise to the bitterness demonstrated against the Religious Orders. The
friar was a Spaniard, the most Spanish, as a general rule, of all the
Spaniards in the Archipelago, and as such became the principal
target.</p>
<p>(See page 148).</p>
<p id="n75"><span class="sc">Note 75.</span> The revolution ever showed
unmistakable signs of a bitter race hatred. When the revolt first broke
forth this race hatred was confined to Spaniards; and it was not until
the breaking out of the insurrection against the lawful authority of
the U. S. that it became general. Till then anyone but a Spaniard could
go from end to end of the Archipelago without molestation; but when the
promises of independence and other things of a like nature, made by the
American Consuls of <span class="corr" id="xd26e5757" title=
"Source: Hong-kong">Hong-Kong</span> and Singapore, and other
irresponsible persons, failed to materialize, the self-asserted leaders
of the people lost confidence in the white man and race hatred
commenced to include all white people. When Aguinaldo&rsquo;s hordes of
<span class="corr" id="xd26e5760" title=

the American forces, the effects of this race-hatred were <span class=

more than ever before in the history of the country. Not only was the
white man to be destroyed, but all those who sympathised with
him&mdash;the <span class="corr" title=

humanity.&rdquo; And how they were going to do it is demonstrated in a
document signed by Aguinaldo, captured by the American forces and

1900. The following are a few extracts from it<span class="corr" id=

of the loyalty of the converts they shall instruct them to continue in
the character of an American sympathizer in order that they may receive
good pay, but without prejudicing the cause of our country. In this way

<p>This race hatred is illustrated very clearly in the definition of
the Katipunan given by Romualdo Teodoro de J., when he said that its
aim was to <i>kill all Spaniards</i> and take possession of the
islands. No particular hatred was shown to any class; it was all
Spaniards of all <span class="corr" id="xd26e5873" title=
"Source: clases">classes</span> and conditions who <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb241" href="#pb241" name="pb241">241</a>]</span>were
to be assassinated. It is also clearly depicted in the Act of Session
of the <i>Katipunan Sur</i> already quoted (See page 81; also foot-note
page 80).</p>
<p id="n76"><span class="sc">Note 76.</span> What Sr. Diaz intends by
<i>Tagalog</i> Katipunan is not quite clear. The whole society was
practically confined to the <span class="corr" id="xd26e5888" title=
"Source: tagalog">Tagalog</span> provinces and was insignificant in
extent even beyond the city of Manila and its suburbs. There was no
other Katipunan.</p>
<p>In November 1895 the assembly of the <i>Katipunan</i> was composed
of ten individuals of the Supreme Council, and the presidents of the
popular sections who were entitled to assist in virtue of holding some
office therein.</p>
<p>In January of the following year of 1896, after the annual election,
the assembly was composed as follows:</p>

<p>&ldquo;I believe we can obtain the dynamite by bribing some of the
harbor employees.&rdquo;</p>
<p>This letter has a foot-note which says: &ldquo;When you have read
this, destroy it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Numeriano Adriano testified (fols. <span class="corr" id="xd26e6002"
title="Source: 1.309">1,309</span>&ndash;<span class="corr" id=
"xd26e6005" title="Source: 1.312">1,312</span>) that Andr&eacute;s
Bonifacio had collected 10,000 pesos for the purchase, in Japan, of
4,000 rifles with abundant ammunition.<a id="xd26e6008" name=
"xd26e6008"></a></p>
<p>He also stated that the arms had been purchased and were to be
landed near by the mountains of San Mateo and in the Batanes islands,
from whence they would be brought to Manila.</p>
<p>That &ldquo;Andr&eacute;s Bonifacio went to San Mateo with men to
receive and arrange arms, whilst Deodato Arellano and Timoteo Paez were
encharged to send people to Batanes to the same end.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Also that &ldquo;It is said that many of the insurgents in the
province of Cavite bear arms of different systems, and he supposed that
they must have been acquired by the rich and wealthy persons of that
province, such as Francisco Osario and others, who knowing perhaps of
the existence of the <i>Liga</i> of Manila, its form and object, had
formed their own also, in the said province, in <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb244" href="#pb244" name=
"pb244">244</a>]</span>order to unite to that of Manila and make common
cause therewith.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Domingo Franco declared (fols. <span class="corr" id="xd26e6023"
title="Source: 1.381">1,381</span>&ndash;<span class="corr" id=
"xd26e6026" title="Source: 1.382">1,382</span>), in answer to a
question during his trial, as to what he knew in reference to the
purchase of arms and <span class="corr" id="xd26e6029" title=
"Source: ammuntion">ammunition</span>, that &ldquo;all he knew was that
arms and ammunition had been purchased, because at the end of 1895, or
the beginning of 1896, he saw Francisco L. Rojas in his office in Calle
Jolo, and the said Rojas told him that he had received a quantity of
arms and ammunition.&rdquo; He stated moreover, that he did not know
the make or number, nor where they had been landed.</p>
<p>Tomas Prieto of Nueva Caceres mentioned the receipt of 50 arms from
Bato. He also stated that Mariano Melgarejo, according to references
from Macario Valentin, received a load of arms in eleven cases from
Pasacao.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Pio Valenzuela affirmed that the arms borne by the rebels were for
the most part domestic bolos<a class="noteref" id="xd26e6036src" href=
"#xd26e6036" name="xd26e6036src">57</a> and lances, and <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb245" href="#pb245" name="pb245">245</a>]</span>that
the chiefs were armed with revolvers.&rdquo; These revolvers were, he
affirmed, acquired from the <i lang="es">Maestranzi de
Artilleria</i>.</p>
<p>Juan Casta&ntilde;eda declared that &ldquo;the Japanese offered to
land here 100,000 rifles with their ammunition, the <span class="corr"
id="xd26e6049" title="Source: expence">expense</span> of which should
be paid in a fixed number of years.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Numeriano Adriano also affirmed that it had been decided to purchase
arms in Japan and that <span class="corr" id="xd26e6055" title=
"Source: ne">one</span> of the islands of the Archipelago should be
given to Japan in exchange for its aid.</p>
<p>Domingo Abella affirmed that he had visited Francisco Rojas in his
office for the purpose of finding out if the arms which the tailor Luis
Villareal had ordered for the society, had arrived; and that although
Francisco Rojas did not belong to the society, he was encharged to
<span class="corr" id="xd26e6060" title="Source: proportion">portion
out</span> the arms and commissioned to bring them to Manila. Francisco
told him that he could not provide him with any as they were all
sold.</p>
<p>The <span class="corr" id="xd26e6065" title=
"Source: nett">net</span> cost of the arms and ammunition necessary to
carry out the revolt was considerable, and as their introduction into
the country would have to be very carefully <span class="corr" id=

with the <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb246" href="#pb246" name=

<span class="corr" id="xd26e6073" title="Source: be be">be</span>
considerably increased. Large sums of money were therefore necessary to
cover expenses. Although the entrance fees and monthly subscriptions
were considerable they could not produce the amount necessary to
provide for the revolution, especially when there existed such a wide
spread <span class="corr" id="xd26e6076" title=

<p>&ldquo;Undoubtedly it (the Katipunan) <span class="corr" id=

money, only the most insignificant part of which, according to report,
was discovered in the possession of Pio Valenzuela, preserved in gold
and amounting, we believe, to less than 30,000 pesos. These resources
could not cover the extraordinary expenses of the propaganda, that of
the Commissioners sent to Japan to treat with that power on the
question of a protectorate, and that of the coming war<a id="xd26e6097"
name="xd26e6097"></a> expenses which were without doubt, very
considerable.</p>

himself permit himself the extravagance of abandoning the <span class=
"corr" id="xd26e6106" title="Source: sedentery">sedentary</span> life
he usually leads, to launch out into the field of adventures of
doubtful result. Those who from the headquarters of the revolution
directed those torpid masses must have realised this, and to make sure
of the exit, caused money to be distributed to all the affiliated and
to their families, giving them at the same time rice in abundance.</p>
<p>&ldquo;On the morning of the events which took place at San Juan del
Monte, two women who live in the Santa Mesa road, were engaged in
giving money to the <i>taos</i><a class="noteref" id="xd26e6113src"
href="#xd26e6113" name="xd26e6113src">59</a> who passed that way,

<p class="tb">. . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .</p>
<p>&ldquo;This money set aside for distribution in San Juan del Monte,

<p class="tb">. . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .</p>
<p>A little further on, the author gives a very broad hint as to one
probable source of funds when he asks the question, where <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb248" href="#pb248" name="pb248">248</a>]</span>is
the <i>million and a half pesos</i> which constitute the default in the
public treasury of Manila?</p>
<p>&ldquo;It would be a curious coincidence,&rdquo; says the author,
&ldquo;if part of this amount perhaps the greater part should have
served as funds from which the expenses of the revolution and the war
were paid.&rdquo;</p>
<p id="n78"><span class="sc">Note 78.</span> The initiations into the
<i>Katipunan</i> were grotesque in the extreme. The person introduced
for initiation was placed in a room draped in black, with its walls
hung with mottoes in Tagalog dialect such as: &ldquo;If you have
courage you may continue,&rdquo; &ldquo;If you have been brought here
by your curiosity, retire.&rdquo; Upon a table was placed a skull, a
loaded revolver and a bolo. A paper upon which were written three
questions lay also upon the table. These questions were<span class=
"corr" id="xd26e6141" title="Source: ;">:</span> &ldquo;In what state
did the Spaniards find the Tagalog people at the time of the conquest?
In what state are they found now? What future can it hope for?</p>
<p>The initiated previously instructed by his god-father, or by the
person who catechised him, was to reply that, at the time of the
arrival of the Spaniards, the <span class="corr" title=
"Source: filipinos">Filipinos</span> <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"pb249" href="#pb249" name="pb249">249</a>]</span>living on the coasts
enjoyed a certain amount of civilization, since they already had
cannons and silk dresses, that they enjoyed political liberty,
sustained diplomatic (sic) relations and commerce with the neighboring
countries of Asia; had their own religion and writing; in a word, lived
happy with their independence. A <i>certain amount</i> of civilization
may be. Let us see what that <i>certain amount</i> was:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Barely clothed, and more often naked, revelling day and night
in <span class="corr" id="xd26e6160" title=
"Source: drunkeness">drunkenness</span>, given to the practice of
infanticide, holding virginity as a dishonor, having among them people
who practiced defloration as a profession, ignorant of the value and
uses of money, making use of men, women and children to pay debts, in
<span class="corr" id="xd26e6163" title=
"Source: continal">continual</span> warfare with one another and
enslaving their prisoners, practicing wholesale murder of slaves on the
death of a chief or important personage, adoring and sacrificing to
rocks, trees, crocodiles and idols of wood; lacking religion, but
having in its stead most <span class="corr" id="xd26e6166" title=
"Source: beastial">bestial</span> and absurd superstitions; without
temples, monuments or even literature, although they possessed a
species of written language. The only human ideas they possessed were
adopted <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb250" href="#pb250" name=
"pb250">250</a>]</span>from the Chinese, Japanese and Borneo
<span class="corr" id="xd26e6171" title=
"Source: mahomedans">Mohammedans</span> whom they imitated after the
manner of apes. This, historians tell us, was the condition of this
people 340 years ago! when the missionaries planted the Cross on
Philippine soil, and brought to the benighted natives the
gospel.&rdquo; So much for the certain amount of civilization.</p>
<p><i>Cannons and silk dresses</i>: of a kind; as to the cannons, where
did they all come from? Bought from or exchanged with the Borneo moros
probably. As to these and the silk dresses, the savages of the
south-sea islands enjoyed the use of such things and enjoyed them with
better knowledge of how to use them! They enjoyed <i>political
liberty</i>; let us see what Morga the historian who speaks most
glowingly of the ancient civilization of the <span class="corr" title=
"Source: filipino">Filipino</span> peoples, has to say on this
point.</p>
<p>He says: &ldquo;In all these islands the people had neither kings
<span class="corr" id="xd26e6186" title="Source: or">nor</span> lords
to dominate them as in other kingdoms and provinces. But in each island
were many chiefs from among the same natives, some greater than others
each one with his subjects, by groups and families, who obeyed and
respected them. Sometimes these chiefs were at peace with <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb251" href="#pb251" name="pb251">251</a>]</span>one
another and some times at war&#8202;&hellip;. The superiority which
these <span class="corr" id="xd26e6191" title=
"Source: chief">chiefs</span> had over the people of their group was
such that they held them as subjects, <i>with power to treat them well
or ill, disposing of their persons, children and estates at their will,
without <span class="corr" id="xd26e6196" title=
"Source: resistence">resistance</span> or the necessity of giving
account to anyone, and for very slight offences they killed and wounded
them and made slaves of them<span class="corr" id="xd26e6199" title=
"Source: .">;</span></i> and if it happened that one of the chiefs were
bathing in the river and a native passed in front of him or looked upon
him with want of respect, and for other similar things, they <i>made
slaves of them for ever</i>.&rdquo; This is a good and practical kind
of political liberty, just the kind of liberty the country would enjoy
if in the hands of the leaders of the Federal Party, so anxious for
liberties for themselves and coercion for those who do not agree with
their way of thinking.</p>
<p><i>Diplomatic relations and commerce with the neighboring countries
of Asia</i>: As to the diplomatic relations the mere idea of such a
thing is <span class="corr" id="xd26e6209" title=
"Source: perposterous">preposterous</span>. If we are to concede the
use of diplomatic relations to the ancient Tagalog people, then we must
consider as diplomatic relations such customs <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb252" href="#pb252" name="pb252">252</a>]</span>as
the passing of the &ldquo;peace pipe&rdquo; practiced by the indian of
the United States, and the giving and accepting of young women for
sensual convenience practiced in many of the islands of the Pacific up
to the present day. As to their foreign commerce let us listen once
more to Morga. &ldquo;Their contracts and negotiations were as a rule
illicit, each one considering the best way to come off successful in
his business.&rdquo;</p>
<p><i>Their own <span class="corr" id="xd26e6217" title=
"Source: religon">religion</span></i>: For a religious system they
worshiped their ancestors and performed human sacrifices. The Spaniards
found in these islands less than a million inhabitants, who were
divided into innumerable tribes governed by rulers who had no more
title of sovereignty than that they were enabled to impose upon the
people by brute force and untold cruelties. The inhabitants formed a
jumble of inferior races some more or less pure in blood, others
intermixed; people speaking many dialects. They all lacked religion, in
the proper sense of the word; they lacked morals, in fact they were
wanting in everything that raises man above the level of the brute
creation.</p>
<p>As to their own writing, certain it is that they possessed a crude
and very inefficient <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb253" href="#pb253"
name="pb253">253</a>]</span>manner of writing, but what is very
remarkable is, that in spite of their possessing a system of script,
not a single piece of their literary work has yet been discovered nor
even a written tradition. This goes to prove that either the
<span class="corr" title="Source: filipinos">Filipinos</span> were at
that time too deep in the savage ages to realise the importance of
writing, or that the form of script was useless for practical
purposes.</p>
<p>To the second question the initiated replied that the friar
missionaries had done nothing to civilize the <span class="corr" title=
"Source: filipinos">Filipinos</span>, as they considered the
civilization and illustration of the country to be incompatible with
their interests<a class="noteref" id="xd26e6232src" href="#xd26e6232"

<p>To the third question the initiated was to reply that they had
faith, courage and <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb255" href="#pb255"

<p>The master of ceremonies warned him that he was taking a very
important and very solemn step, and he was recommended to retire if he
did not feel courage enough to continue since he would uselessly expose
his life. If the initiated insisted in continuing with the mysteries of
the initiation he was presented to the reunion of the brethren to be
tried by the proofs assigned, which were very similar to those adopted
in universal masonry, but surrounded with more paganism, if that be
possible. He was blindfolded and made to discharge a revolver against
an imaginary enemy, a person he was made to believe really was present
and awaiting <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb256" href="#pb256" name=

him pay the penalty of a treason. If he passed through the proofs
successfully he was introduced into the hall of oaths and there with
his own blood, drawn by means of an <span class="corr" id="xd26e6280"

first thing the separatists desired was to get rid of the Peninsular

<p>It is well nigh impossible to imagine to what the liberty of the

American states which are <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb257" href=

unable to govern themselves in spite of the political superiority of

without an unending series of revolutions, what <span class="corr" id=

himself Emperor Pedro I? And before the new Emperor could install
himself in Malaca&ntilde;an he would have at his heels a thousand and
one petty chiefs, princes, kings and perhaps even a few ambitious
queens!</p>
<p>It is over a half a century ago since the South American Republics
became independent, and at that time the rest of the world cared but
little for the consequences of such a step. But this indifference of
the nations can never exist here in the Orient at the <span class=

<p>The question of the expulsion from the country or the destruction of
the Spaniards has been spoken of under several notes; the idea was,
doubtless, a semi-savage interpretation of the preachings and teachings
spread abroad by the Bible societies in all parts and especially in
Spanish countries. And this becomes the more probable when we call to
mind what the <i lang="es">El Imparcial</i> of the 26th of August 1896
published concerning this identical point. Speaking of the state of the
country in general as a result of the insurrection, it says:</p>
<p>&ldquo;The minister of Foreign affairs received a telegram yesterday
from General Blanco manifesting that more arrests had been
made&#8202;&hellip;.</p>
<p class="tb">. . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .</p>
<p>The conjuration had ramifications in various parts of the

Bible societies&#8202;&hellip;.</p>

were <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb259" href="#pb259" name=

a revolt which was planned out in the houses of Joaquin Pardo de Tavera
and Jacinto Zamora. The three priests were executed by the <span class=

with Francisco Saldua. Gomez left the sum of <span class="corr" id=

</blockquote>
<p id="n84"><span class="sc">Note 84.</span> Pio Valenzuela, who gave
some of the most interesting and reliable information concerning the
inner life of the <i>Katipunan</i>, testified (fols. 1,663&ndash;1,673)
that on the 30th of November 1895, the birthday of Bonifacio, a meeting
was held in Caloocan, in a house situated in the rice fields, some
thirty five or forty individuals assisting thereat, among them being
the witness. This meeting continued all day and all night till the
following day, the first of December. At this meeting they pronounced
the death sentence upon the tailor Guzman for publishing the secrets of
the <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb261" href="#pb261" name=
"pb261">261</a>]</span><i>Katipunan</i>; this sentence was signed by
all present including the witness, after he had made many observations
against it, observations the rest would not listen to. One of the
lighter punishments meted out was the public exposition in the lodge
rooms of the picture of the person punished, with the word
<i>traitor</i> <span class="corr" id="xd26e6407" title=
"Source: writer">written</span> over or under it.</p>
<p id="n85"><span class="sc">Note 85.</span> The <i>Katipunan</i>
enjoyed a peculiar and special organization, which was given to it in
order to avoid surprises and treachery. The assemblies were always held
in secluded places and under the cover of the greatest secrecy.
Sometimes they were held at midnight in the open cornfields so as not
to attract the attention of those indians who were not members of the
society. Valenzuela relates how a secret meeting was held in the pueblo
of Pasig at midnight, on one <span class="corr" id="xd26e6417" title=

annexation of the Islands to Japan in case that nation did not care to

<p id="n86"><span class="sc">Note 86.</span> Pio Valenzuela mentioned
one occasion upon which such a meeting of the society was held, he
himself assisting thereat, in the house of Andr&eacute;s Bonifacio. It
was a supper given in honor of the baptism of a child to which the said
Valenzuela was god-father. After the supper, which served as a shield
under the which the work of the lodge was to be done, an election was
held for the Supreme and the Popular Councils, and the sections. Some
thirty members were present.</p>
<p>Another case he mentioned was that of a meeting held on the
<span class="corr" id="xd26e6468" title=
"Source: birth-day">birthday</span> of Bonifacio 30th of November
1895.</p>
<p>The Katipunan moreover had its own festivals. This is how Valenzuela
describes them:</p>
<p>&ldquo;The Katipunan held its festival, according as Andr&eacute;s
Bonifacio had told the witness, on the 7th of July, anniversary of the
<span class="corr" id="xd26e6475" title=
"Source: fountation">foundation</span> of the society; it also
celebrated another anniversary on the 28th of February, <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb263" href="#pb263" name="pb263">263</a>]</span>the
date of the execution of the three native priests, Burgos, Gomez and
Zamora (see note 81). On that day a catafalque draped with black cloth,
was erected in each one of the popular Councils, having four
<i>hachones</i><a class="noteref" id="xd26e6482src" href="#xd26e6482"
name="xd26e6482src">62</a>, one in each of its four angles, adorned
with crowns made with plants named <i>Macabuhay</i><a class="noteref"
id="xd26e6487src" href="#xd26e6487" name="xd26e6487src">63</a>. All the
members filed before the funeral pile, reciting prayers for the dead
and swearing to avenge the death of the three priests.</p>
<p id="n87"><span class="sc">Note 87.</span> Roman Baza, who was one of
the many who suffered the death penalty for his treason, undertook to
educate in ultra-democratic ideas, (as Isabelo de los Reyes is doing in
our days), all he came in contact with. He printed and spread abroad
the &ldquo;rights of man&rdquo; of the French revolution.</p>
<p>He was at one time president of the <i>Katipunan</i> (see p. 44) but
being a man little suited to carry out to a successful issue the set
plans of the society, Bonifacio determined <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb264" href="#pb264" name="pb264">264</a>]</span>to
remove him, by what Sr. Diaz terms a <i lang=
"fr">coup-d&rsquo;etat</i>, but more properly called an underhand
trick. Bonifacio, at that time treasurer, forced a conflict on the
subject of the financial conditions of the society, being denounced as
an exploiter for his pains. The quarrel was settled by an election,
Bonifacio by his unholy influence carrying all before him.</p>
<p>It was during the presidency of Baza that the Katipunan society for
women was founded, &ldquo;the object of which was <i>mutual succor</i>
(!)<span class="corr" title="Not in source">.</span> <span class="corr"
id="xd26e6512" title="Source: the">The</span> institution serving at
the same time to dissimulate the meetings of the male
<i>Katipuneros</i>. Whilst the latter were holding their sessions in a
retired room, the women were in the salon with some young men dancing,
singing or eating. The presidentess of this society of <i>mutual
succorers</i> was Mariana Dizon.</p>
<p>To secure admission it was necessary to be a daughter or sister of
one of the male members. Mariana Dizon later on married Jos&eacute;
Turiano Santiago, and as a result, the female <i>Katipunan</i>, as an
organization was broken up, the late members however continuing to
shield as before, the labors of the Katipunan reunions. <span class=

<span class="corr" id="xd26e6540" title=

<p id="n89"><span class="sc">Note 89.</span> Jos&eacute; Dizon Matanza
stated during his trial (<span class="corr" id="xd26e6547" title=
"Source: fol.">fols.</span> 1,132&ndash;1,138) &ldquo;that Pio
Valenzuela <span class="corr" id="xd26e6550" title=
"Source: saught">sought</span> money from the wealthy, and as he (the
prisoner) understood, from a statement of Bonifacio, had collected over
a thousand pesos for the object of covering the expenses of the trip
which he made to Dapitan to confer with Rizal; and in order to fool the
authorities he took with him a blind individual with his guide, that
Rizal might perform a cure or some operation upon the blind man. The
motive of the conference was the proposition to Rizal of the armed
rebellion, etc., etc.&rdquo; <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb266" href=
"#pb266" name="pb266">266</a>]</span></p>
<p>Valenzuela himself spoke of this trip to Dapitan (see note <a href=
"#n16">16</a>, p. 133) as follows:&mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;In the month of May of that year 1896, a reunion was held in
Pasig and there it was agreed to send a commission to Japan &hellip;
and it was agreed also to commence the armed rebellion, settling the
manner in which it should be carried out, but it was decided that,
previous to taking action it would be wise to consult with Rizal, the
witness being chosen as emissary. The schoolmaster of Cavite Viejo, by
name Santos, proposed that a blind man named Raymundo Mata should
accompany Valenzuela that Rizal might cure him. The witness embarked on
the S. S. Venus at the end of May, meeting on board, one of
Rizal&rsquo;s sisters, and his (Rizal&rsquo;s) <i lang=
"es">querida</i>, an American or English woman named Josefina; and
arriving at Dapitan, the witness went ashore with the two women and a
servant that accompanied them, making their way to the house of Rizal,
etc., etc.&rdquo;</p>
<p>According to a statement of Isabelo de los Reyes, &ldquo;Rizal, as
has been clearly proved at the trials (of traitors) advised them to
wait another two years, as they lacked arms.&rdquo;</p>
<p>I wonder if Rizal foresaw the war to <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"pb267" href="#pb267" name="pb267">267</a>]</span>break out <i>two
years</i> later between Spain and the United States! His intense desire
to go to Cuba would give one that idea.</p>
<p id="n90"><span class="sc">Note 90.</span> Negotiations indeed! Who
can imagine the circumspect and formal little nation of Japan
<span class="corr" id="xd26e6578" title=
"Source: admiting">admitting</span> negotiations with a warehouse
porter, a man who was representative only of the worst of the lowest
classes! Sr. Diaz probably made this statement from hearsay <i lang=
"es">por boca de ganso</i> as they say in Spanish. If any negotiations
took place between Bonifacio and the Japanese Government they were on a
par with those between the late U. S. Consuls of Singapore and
Hong-Kong, and a few other irresponsible people, and Aguinaldo, the
leader of the <i>Katipunan</i>.</p>
<p id="n91"><span class="sc">Note 91.</span> As has been seen in the
foregoing notes, it was the intention of the <i>separatists</i> to make
purchases of arms and their necessary ammunition in Japan. Those
wealthy <span class="corr" title="Source: filipinos">Filipinos</span>
who were owners of steamships were looked to as the chief assistance in
the transportation and landing of the said arms, etc.</p>
<p>The date of the arrival of the arms, <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"pb268" href="#pb268" name="pb268">268</a>]</span>according as appeared
from evidence given during the trial of Francisco L. Roxas, was to have
been the 31st of December 1896. Lorenzo de la Paz, however, stated that
it was the 1st of September of the said year. Others claimed it to be
the 13th of September or the 30th of November. As may be easily seen,
there was no lack of disagreement among the chiefs of the revolt, and
perhaps, as far as the majority were concerned, still more
exploitation.</p>
<p id="n92"><span class="sc">Note 92.</span> Pio Valenzuela y
Alejandrino was a licentiate of <span class="corr" id="xd26e6605"
title="Source: Medecine">Medicine</span>, and one of the members of the
inferior Supreme Council of the Katipunan. According to his own story
he entered the files of the society under compulsion at the hands of
Andr&eacute;s Bonifacio, who on the strength of a love affair, gave him
the alternative of death or membership in the Katipunan (see p. 132).
In his declaration during his trial (fol. 142&ndash;147) on the 6th of
September 1896, he recorded how on the 30 day of November, S.
Andrew&rsquo;s day of the year 1895, he was presented by Andr&eacute;s
Bonifacio to various <i>Katipuneros</i> as &ldquo;brother&rdquo; Medico
(Doctor), Bonifacio stating that from that time he <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb269" href="#pb269" name=
"pb269">269</a>]</span>(Valenzuela) would be the doctor of the society.
He also stated how, in the following month of January and in another
meeting, he was nominated Fiscal, and official doctor with a salary of
thirty pesos monthly, a salary he had no little difficulty in
collecting. He was commissioned in May 1896 to go to Dapitan to hold a
conference with Rizal concerning armed rising against the supreme
authority of Spain in the Archipelago; but Rizal was shrewder and more
far-sighted than the others and would not consent to the <span class=
"corr" id="xd26e6613" title="Source: carryiug">carrying</span> out of
the scheme as proposed by Bonifacio. On the return of Valenzuela
Bonifacio imposed upon him a strict <span class="corr" id="xd26e6616"
title="Source: sllence">silence</span> concerning the outcome of the
conference; but being pressed by certain members of the society, among
whom were Emilio Jacinto, Secretary of the Supreme Council, and
<i>capita</i> Ramon of Pandacan, he revealed the secret of
Rizal&rsquo;s opposition to a plan he feared would be abortive. When
once the cat was out of the bag the facts soon became public among the
principal members, with the result that many who had promised funds for
the purchase of arms etc. in Japan, refused to pay the amounts
promised. Among these was a <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb270" href=
"#pb270" name="pb270">270</a>]</span>colonel of Malabon who had
promised 500 pesos for the said object. This breach of confidence on
the part of Valenzuela brought about the separation of himself and
<span class="corr" id="xd26e6625" title=
"Source: Boniiacio">Bonifacio</span>, and the former presented his
<span class="corr" id="xd26e6628" title=
"Source: resignatfon">resignation</span> as doctor and fiscal of the
society. Bonifacio opposed the idea of his resignation but it was
finally accepted, and the former friends parted company each to work in
his own sphere.</p>
<p>Valenzuela was in fact one of the chief movers of the rebellion;
this was confessed by Domingo Franco, the late president of the then
<span class="corr" id="xd26e6633" title=
"Source: difunct">defunct</span> <i lang="es">Liga <span class="corr"
id="xd26e6638" title="Source: filipina">Filipina</span></i>. &ldquo;The
rebellion,&rdquo; says he, &ldquo;was produced by a foolish child,
whose name it would dirty the tongue to pronounce, because after being
the author of all (this however is somewhat inexact) has given himself
up to the authorities to denounce those he has succeeded in
misleading.&rdquo;</p>
<p>During his trial in the Bilibid prison, before Col. Francisco Olive
y Garc&iacute;a on the 2nd of September 1896, he gave some of the most
interesting and reliable information that has yet been gathered
concerning the interior workings and doings of the Katipunan.
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb271" href="#pb271" name=
"pb271">271</a>]</span></p>
<p>When the Guardia Civil set out from Manila to break up
Bonifacio&rsquo;s party in Caloocan, several of those forming the
leadership fled, and among them Valenzuela. He entered Manila by way of
Sampaloc, passing through Quiapo to the Escolta and down the <i>Pasaje
de P&eacute;rez</i>, embarking there on one of the lake steamers. On
arrival at Bi&ntilde;ang he went to the house of the co-adjutor D.
Silvino Manaol (native priest), to whom he recounted what had taken
place. The co-adjutor asked of the parish priest the proclamation of
the Governor General conceding pardon to those who should present
themselves<a class="noteref" id="xd26e6649src" href="#xd26e6649" name=
"xd26e6649src">64</a>. Having read it with care and under the advice of
the co-adjutor, he set out for the capital <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb272" href="#pb272" name=
"pb272">272</a>]</span>disembarking at the Ayala bridge from whence he
took a <i lang="es">quiles</i> and went <span class="corr" id=

palace of the Governor to present himself to him<span class="corr"
title="Source: ,">.</span> The Governor General was not at home so
Valenzuela at once started for the offices of the Military
Government.</p>
<p>Speaking of this giving up of himself of Valenzuela, Sr. Jos&eacute;
M. del Castillo y Jimenez says: &ldquo;The forty-eight hours conceded
by the proclamation of the Governor Blanco were about to close when
there reached the palace of Sta. Potenciana, worn out, bathed in
perspiration, and almost in a period of agony, Pio Valenzuela, an
important person of revolution he being in such a condition that it was
necessary to assist him previous to his passing into the presence of
Gov. Blanco. When he had come to himself and was in a condition to make
an explicit and ample confession he had two hours conference with the
Governor, giving information of as such as he knew.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="tb">. . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .</p>

acquainted with the seducing nature of the masonic operation and the
peculiarity of the native character, would wonder to find the name of a
Catholic priest so intimately connected with freemasonry and its
offspring, especially in a country in which the Church wages close and
continual warfare with the evil. There is little need for surprise
however, when we consider the seductive influence of the one hand and
the simplicity and childishness of the native character on the other.
Many of the native clergy were body and soul wrapt up in the workings
of freemasonry and were Spain&rsquo;s worst and most crafty
enemies.</p>

&ldquo;<span lang="es">La Independencia</span>&rdquo; was a
revolutionary daily of four pages, published in the Orphan Asylum of
Malabon, property of the Augustinian Corporation and stolen and
eventually totally destroyed by the &ldquo;ever destructive&rdquo;
Tagalog rebels during the revolution. The first number was published on
Saturday, 3rd Sept<span class="corr" title="Not in source">.</span>
1898. Its leading article is an exposition of the purpose of the
publication of the paper, which was the defense of the independence of
the Philippines. &ldquo;We defend, says the writer of the article, the
independence of the <span class="corr" id="xd26e2793" title=
"Source: Philipines">Philippines</span> because it is the aspiration of
the country which has come of age; and when a people rise as a man to
protest, arm in hand, against a policy of oppression and injustice, it
manifests sufficient vitality to live free.&rdquo; This is a fair
sample of the style of the conduct of the paper. It is worthy of note
that the history of the revolt has clearly shown that, in the first
place, independence was not the aspiration of the <i>people</i>, but a
fanciful hope of a handful of exploiters; secondly that the country has
not come of age, not having even reached the age of <span class="corr"
id="xd26e2802" title="Source: pubety">puberty</span>; thirdly that the
<i>people</i> did not rise as a man but that the Tagal
&ldquo;discontents&rdquo; were the body and soul of the whole
insurrection both against Spain and against the U. S.; and finally,
that the &ldquo;policy of oppression and injustice&rdquo; was
imaginary, the same complaint having since been made against the
Government of Washington as was then made against the Government of
Madrid. The quotation concerning Luna is taken from No. 2 of the paper
published on the 5th of Sept. 1898.&nbsp;<a class="fnarrow" href=

principal works of Juan Luna are: <i>The death of Cleopatra</i> for
which he received a silver medal; this was painted under the tutorship
of Sr. Vera. Under the same master he painted the <i>Spoliarium</i> for

of the picture but in order to put an end to a rivalry between two
Spanish painters. On his own account he painted and gave forth <i>The

criticized. Also the <i>Profanation of the Tombs</i>; if anything this
was worse. As the savage nature which lay dormant in his breast became

his <span lang="es">Pacto-de-Sangre</span>, in the which he inspired

interesting pamphlet entitled &ldquo;Vexata Questio&rdquo;, giving a
brief sketch of three centuries of history in the Philippines,
published in Manila in 1901, the author, in a foot note to page 28,
says of Foreman:</p>
<p class="footnote cont">&ldquo;It should be remarked that this writer,
in the first edition of his work, claims to be an earnest Catholic.
Dean Worcester, who copies from Foreman&rsquo;s book some of the most
drivelling paragraphs, lays particular stress upon this fact. I leave
it to the common sense of any one who has read Foreman&rsquo;s history,
or what Worcester <span class="corr" id="xd26e3679" title=
"Source: strops">stoops</span> so low to copy therefrom, whether a man
whose Alpha and Omega is truly anti-Catholic and often anti-christian,
and the ink of whose pen savors of Catholic blood shed upon the altars
of Freemasonry can be a Catholic, at least an honorable one.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="footnote cont">Foreman was a traveller in machinery and as
such was enabled to get to all the principal parts of the Archipelago.
He was, as he himself confesses, always well received in the pueblos,
and greeted by the parish priests (friars) and lodged in the convents
free of cost. Although Foreman did not perform vile practical jokes
upon unsuspecting and <span class="corr" id="xd26e3684" title=
"Source: innoffensive">inoffensive</span> hosts as did the now
&ldquo;commissioner&rdquo; Worcester in his travels, he did many things
no honorable man would have done. Although he professed himself a
Catholic it was only for &ldquo;business&rdquo; purposes; one has only
to read the preface to his book to find that out.</p>
<p class="footnote cont">Foreman was an Englishman, disliked by the
English, despised by everyone he came in contact with; and if the
things said of him by his intimate acquaintances, are true, then he
well deserved the snubs he has lately received all round.</p>
<p class="footnote cont">On the 17th of April 1899, before the members
of the Schurman Commission, Neil Macleod testified of Foreman, as
follows:</p>

Satan finds mischief for idle hands, and when one devil is driven out

re-enters the soul and &ldquo;the last state of that man becomes worse
than the first.&rdquo; So to thoroughly carry out their christianizing
and civilizing purpose they did their best to instruct their converts
to occupy their time in the fields, in the building of houses, of
churches, of structures of all kinds necessary. They taught them to be
self-supporting and to build up happy homes around them<span class=

moreover the connection with these anti-christian influences had to be
cut for the moral protection of the indian and therefore the friar
missionary, ever on the alert for his children&rsquo;s welfare,
instructed them in industries which, whilst occupying their time
formerly spent in abject laziness, also gave them the advantage of
money making.</p>
<p class="footnote cont">&ldquo;As soon as the natives had become

<p>As the common belief was that this paper was published in Japan, as

Villeta was chosen; but on account of some hitch in the arrangements,
he never started on his errand. Some say that the paper did not reach
its second number, but it is certain that it did not reach its
third.</p>

<p>This latter article is a mirror in which the purpose of the paper is
reflected; it reads remarkably like a composition of Pedro Paterno, the
visionary who claims for the peoples of the Archipelago a glorious
pre-Spanish history and civilization. The following citations from the
article will give some idea of the whole publication.</p>
<p>&ldquo;In these islands, which were previously cared for by our true
neighbors of Malaysia at a time when the Spaniards had not as yet set
foot upon the land, there existed a complete abundance and a state of
welfare. Our friends the neighboring kingdoms, and especially Japan,
brought commerce to our shores which formed the most abundant market,
and there was found everything necessary, wherefore it was the richest
country and its customs were all very good<a class="noteref" id=

<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb278" href="#pb278" name=

<p>The article goes on to say that upon the arrival of the Spaniards
the natives only made friends with them after that Legazpi had
performed the ceremonies of the <i lang=
"es">pacto-de-Sangre</i><a class="noteref" id="xd26e6941src" href=

<p>&ldquo;The Spaniards,&rdquo; says the writer, &ldquo;have perverted
us with their bad customs and have destroyed and obliged us to forget
the noble and beautiful customs of our country.&rdquo;</p>
<p><i>Noble and beautiful customs</i>: Compulsory defloration of young
girls, as a result of the belief that a girl who died a virgin could
not enter heaven! Could anything be more noble and beautiful?</p>

<p id="n94"><span class="sc">Note 94.</span> Pio Valenzuela testified
(fols<span class="corr" title="Not in source">.</span> 582&ndash;591)
that on the 22nd of August he was informed by Josefa Dizon that her son
Jos&eacute; together with Bonifacio had fled from Manila. Valenzuela
thereupon fled also, following them, and reaching Caloocan about 8 p.
m. There he found Bonifacio with some twenty others. Andr&eacute;s
informed them that they must not <span class="corr" id="xd26e6982"
title="Source: seperate">separate</span> as it was now time to commence
the armed rebellion, the plot of the Katipunan having been discovered.
From Caloocan they went to Balintauac arriving about 11 p. m. Here they
met a certain Laong with a group of men. They remained in the pueblo
Sunday, Monday and Tuesday preparing for the onslaught they were to
make upon the Spaniards, which was fixed for the 29th of the same
month, the plans being that they should advance in groups upon Manila,
killing the Spaniards and also the indians and <span class="corr" id=
"xd26e6985" title="Source: chinese">Chinese</span> who refused to
follow them, &ldquo;<i>dedicating themselves to the sacking of the
city, robbery and incendiarism and to the violation of
women</i>.&rdquo; Many <span class="corr" id="xd26e6991" title=
"Source: chinese">Chinese</span> were murdered and their stores
robbed.</p>
<p>Whilst in the fields of Balintauac distribution was made of bolos
and ten revolvers, the latter stolen from the Maestranza <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb280" href="#pb280" name="pb280">280</a>]</span>of
Manila. On Tuesday evening preparations were made to meet the attack of
the Spanish troops which had been sent out in persecution of the
rebels, and the first conflict took place. Valenzuela also stated that
the greater part of the people who formed the rebel forces were drawn,
catechised and initiated all in a moment by the fanatic Laong, who was
practically the active chief of the revolt, and who directed in person
the attack upon the <span class="corr" id="xd26e6998" title=
"Source: chinese">Chinese</span> stores.</p>
<p>About 5 pm. on the 29th<a id="xd26e7003" name="xd26e7003"></a> five
hundred men under a &ldquo;leader of Pasig&rdquo; appeared on the scene
at the waterworks. They at once took possession of the building and of
the persons of the workmen. Their first intention was to stop the
machinery so that no one need be left in charge thereof when orders
should be received for a start for Manila. The engineer however,
reminded the chief that if such a thing was done their brethren in
Manila would die of thirst. This excuse carried the day and the chief
decided to leave some workmen there under the condition that the
engineer and others who wore moustaches should shave, and that all
should dress like indians, and that the engineer&rsquo;s wife should
dress like a native woman <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb281" href=
"#pb281" name="pb281">281</a>]</span>and prepare food for his men. The
party finally set out on their way. They tried to avoid an encounter
with the <span class="corr" id="xd26e7007" title=
"Source: trops">troops</span> composed of artillery and infantry, 65
men in all, stationed at the powder works. In avoiding this handful of
defenders they fell afoul of other troops which gave them a good sharp
reception.</p>
<p>As to those who, repenting, desired to return to a legal status, it
is difficult to form an opinion, on account of the contrary evidence
adduced in connection therewith. Isabelo de los Reyes already cited, in
a futile attempt to justify the acts of the Katipuneros, claims that
some of the chiefs opposed the plan of the armed resistance as
contained in the propositions of Bonifacio, claiming that <span class=
"corr" id="xd26e7012" title="Source: ti">it</span> would be a great and
useless sacrifice, to say nothing of the imprudence of such an act, to
launch forth against an armed force without possessing better arms than
a few bolos and lances. He claims that Bonifacio listened to the advice
and was on the point of acting upon it, but was compelled to take the
step he did in declaring the revolt, by the attitude of his 500
followers. The authority for this statement was Pedro Nicodemus, who
was the commander of the said <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb282"
href="#pb282" name="pb282">282</a>]</span>group, a man who was as
ignorant as he was blood-thirsty.</p>
<p>Further on Isabelo states that &ldquo;in the famous reunion of
<span class="corr" id="xd26e7019" title=
"Source: Balintanac">Balintauac</span>, in the solemn moment of the
breaking forth of the revolt (August, 26th 1896) <span class="corr" id=
"xd26e7022" title="Source: Andres">Andr&eacute;s</span> Bonifacio as
president of the Supreme Council of the Katipunan, explained that the
plot had been discovered, and that in order to save those who were
compromised and who had not up to that time been arrested, it was
necessary to launch forth to the fight, although the arms with which
they should fight had not yet arrived from Japan.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Granted however the character of Bonifacio, his aims and the methods
he adopted to carry out his ideas, such an excuse as that of Reyes
argue but little in pro of the good judgement or better said the good
faith of its author. Bonifacio was anxious for the first blow of the
revolt to be struck that he might not <span class="corr" id="xd26e7027"
title="Source: loose">lose</span> the confidence of those who had
intrusted him with the undertaking and who had been fooled into the
idea that the Katipunan forces were so powerful that nothing could
resist their onward course once they had been started on their way. And
to suppose that Bonifacio <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb283" href=
"#pb283" name="pb283">283</a>]</span>was to be so easily influenced by
a few petty chiefs is to show a complete ignorance of the character of
the hero of the Katipunan. If the opposition of the said petty chiefs
really occurred it was probably inspired more by fear of the
consequences than by the true spirit of repentance, for if the
cruelties and abuses said to have been committed by the Spaniards were
the cause of the revolt, what need was there of such a repentance?</p>
<p>The prestige enjoyed by Bonifacio among the katipuneros was natural
enough, in as much as he was the father of the <i>Katipunan</i>, the
illegitimate offspring of filipino freemasonry, itself a legitimate
child of the Spanish family of universal freemasonry.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The <span class="corr" id="xd26e7039" title=
"Source: katipunan">Katipunan</span>,&rdquo; says the author of an
exposition to Congress, dated 1900 and published at the printing office
of the <i lang="es">El Liberal</i>, &ldquo;the worthy and
legitimate<a class="noteref" id="xd26e7045src" href="#xd26e7045" name=
"xd26e7045src">5</a> child of Andr&eacute;s Bonifacio, was founded in
his <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb284" href="#pb284" name=
"pb284">284</a>]</span>own house in calle Sagunto (Tondo) between six
and seven in the evening of the 7th of July 1892. Andr&eacute;s
Bonifacio gathered together his best friends, Teodoro Plata, Valentin
D&iacute;az, Ladislao <span class="corr" id="xd26e7053" title=
"Source: Diua">Dina</span>, Deodato <span class="corr" id="xd26e7057"
title="Source: Arelano">Arellano</span>, and Ildefonso Laurel, to whom
he proposed the necessity of the creation of that Superior Association
of the Sons of the People, whose only aim should be that of the
independence of the people under a Spanish protectorate or in default
of that, of Japan. Those assembled took to the idea with great
enthusiasm and at once commenced the propaganda of the same.</p>
<p id="n95"><span class="sc">Note 95.</span> One thing which clearly
demonstrates the state of fanaticism and moral degradation to which the
<i>Katipunan</i> fell, was the savage manner in which they treated the
Religious prisoners who fell into their hands. Disrespect for all
authority and especially that of the clergy, was one of the chief
fruits of the work of propaganda carried on by Rizal and other of the
<span class="corr" id="xd26e7068" title=
"Source: seperatist">separatist</span> element, aided and abetted by
the Bible societies who gave moral as well as practical assistance to
their labors.</p>
<p>As fanaticism increased, this want of respect <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb285" href="#pb285" name=
"pb285">285</a>]</span>became more intense and eventually led to a
thirst for the blood of those whose greatest crime was the excessive
favor they had extended to the indian, to whom such a thing as
gratitude was unknown<a class="noteref" id="xd26e7075src" href=
"#xd26e7075" name="xd26e7075src">6</a>.</p>
<p>As we have seen, the intention of the Katipuneros was the
annihilation of the Spaniards, irrespective of class or condition. The
parish priest being the strongest support of the administration was the
target for the bitterest treatment at the hands of the rebels.</p>
<p>Among the number of those parish priests murdered by the
<span class="corr" id="xd26e7090" title=
"Source: tagalog">Tagalog</span> rebels were P. Toribio Moreno;
Recolet, parish priest of Silang; P. Toribio Mateo, Recolet and parish
priest of Perez Dasmari&ntilde;as; and the lay brothers: fray Luis
Garbayo and Julian Umbon, these latter were murdered in San Francisco
de Malabon. Upon the Estate of Imus, then property of the Recolet
Corporation, now in the possession of a large London Syndicate, were
most brutally murdered the following Recolets: <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb286" href="#pb286" name="pb286">286</a>]</span></p>
<p>P. Jos&eacute; Ma. Learte, ex-Provincial and parish priest of Imus,
P. Simeon Marin, ex-Definitor and parish priest of Maragondon, P.
Agipito Echegoyen, parish priest of Amadeo, P. Faustino Lizasoain,
parish priest of Bailen, and the lay-brothers:</p>
<p>Roman Caballero, Jorge Zueco del Rosario, Damaso Go&ntilde;i,
Bernardo Angos, Victoriano L&oacute;pez.</p>
<p>It is affirmed by eye-witnesses that these victims to <span class=
"corr" id="xd26e7100" title="Source: tagalog">Tagalog</span> fanaticism
were saturated with petroleum and burned alive.</p>
<p>Fear was entertained for the safety of of several Dominican Fathers
who held parishes near by, and therefore P. Buenaventura Campa, P.
Francisco Cabe&ntilde;as and fray Natalio Esparza immediately set out
in search for them. Regardless of the great risk they ran in falling
into the hands of the bloodthirsty Katipuneros, these three heroic
Dominicans casting aside all thought for <span class="corr" id=
"xd26e7105" title="Source: sel">self</span> and all care for their own
welfare<a class="noteref" id="xd26e7108src" href="#xd26e7108" name=
"xd26e7108src">7</a> set out <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb287" href=
"#pb287" name="pb287">287</a>]</span>for Naic in the steam launch
<i>Mariposa</i>. Difficulties were encountered from the start. The
native captain and engineer conspired to prevent the carrying out of
the attempted rescue. P. Buenaventura calling up the refractory captain
told him that he and his companions were firm in their purpose and that
progress must be made. The captain pleaded inability for want of coal.
Then hoist the sails, said P. Campa. There are none replied the
captain. Then take my habit and those of my companions and make<a id=
"xd26e7118" name="xd26e7118"></a> sails of them, thundered the Padre.
The captain gave in and the journey was continued. Naic was reached;
they failed to find their companions but were in time to save the
unfortunate wife and children of Lieut. Perez Herrero; they discovered
them barefooted and wellnigh mad with terror, dressed in native clothes
and hidden in a <i>nipa</i> shack. P. Galo Minguez, parish priest of
Naic, Padres Nicol&aacute;s Pe&ntilde;a and Jos&eacute; Digne and the
laybrothers Saturnino Garc&iacute;a and Jos&eacute; Pedida had
succeeded in escaping from the <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb288"
href="#pb288" name="pb288">288</a>]</span>clutches of the rebellious
<span class="corr" id="xd26e7126" title=
"Source: tagalogs">Tagalogs</span>, having fled to Labay from whence
they made their way to Corregidor, meeting there those who had come to
seek them in the <i>Mariposa</i>.</p>
<p>The Augustinian Father P. Piernavieja was another victim to
fanaticism. This Father has been termed <i lang="es">medio
loco</i><a class="noteref" id="xd26e7136src" href="#xd26e7136" name=
"xd26e7136src">8</a> and in all truth he was so if the possession of a
presence of mind such as that shown by P. Piernavieja is to be termed
craziness. True it is that he was at times gifted with a strange turn
of mind. He had, during the many years he administered the parish,
established therein a christian communism. When the revolt broke out he
was held as a prisoner and obliged to invest himself with the authority
of an Archbishop. Had the revolt prospered and P. Piernavieja lived,
undoubtedly he would have been made Archbishop of Manila by the
<span class="corr" id="xd26e7139" title=
"Source: tagalog">Tagalog</span> discontents. P. Piernavieja was shrewd
enough to take well to his new office. He was once called upon to
<span class="corr" id="xd26e7142" title="Source: annoint">anoint</span>
the chiefs and rulers, as the kings and emperors of olden time were
<span class="corr" id="xd26e7145" title=
"Source: annointed">anointed</span> by the Church. Padre Piernavieja
told them that olive oil was not <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb289"
href="#pb289" name="pb289">289</a>]</span>suitable for such a purpose
and therefore proceeded to anoint them with <i>cocoanut</i> oil such as
is used by the natives for their lamps! Under pretext of his office of
Bishop this strange old man claimed liberty to make his pastoral visits
and when he succeeded in securing this liberty which was readily
granted to him, he overran all that part of the province in the hands
of the insurgents, secretly collecting all kinds of information, which
he immediately sent his superiors in Manila. This information reached
the military authorities and would have become of utility to them for
the carrying out of the campaign had it been prosecuted as a military
campaign should have been. But the Padre&rsquo;s messenger was
eventually captured with messages in his possession. When questioned as
to the source of the information, and where he was taking it, he told
all, and as a result Padre Piernavieja was condemned to death as a
traitor to a cause to which he had never held allegiance. As a
punishment he was tied to a tree exposed to the burning rays of the
tropical sun, and thus left to the mercy of the voracious birds and
insects, <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb290" href="#pb290" name=
"pb290">290</a>]</span>dying of hunger, thirst and of terror in the
midst of inconceivable torments.</p>
<p>Padre David Veras, Dominican, was another of the many victims of the
<i lang="es">Katipuneros</i>. He was the parish priest of the pueblo of
Hermosa in the province of Bataan. When the insurgents attacked the
pueblo they captured P. David, and after cutting <span class="corr" id=
"xd26e7161" title="Source: of">off</span> both his hands, dragged him
to the most distant of the ten <i lang="es">barrios</i> of that pueblo,
and there hacked him to death with <i lang="es">bolos</i> and hatchets
mutilating his body in a horrible manner, and throwing the corpse on to
a dung heap.</p>
<p>In the early dawn of the 25th of December 1896, in Morong province
of Bataan, Padre Domingo Cabrejas, Recolet, was murdered at the altar
while offering up the holy sacrifice of the Mass, his blood staining
the sacred linen and the steps of the altar. The <i lang=
"es">katipunero</i> murderers <span class="corr" id="xd26e7175" title=
"Source: huriedly">hurriedly</span> hid the body in the church and
fled.</p>
<p>Padre Jos&eacute; Sanjuan, also Recolet and parish priest of Bagac
was another victim. To name all those who suffered barbarous treatment
at the <i>merciful</i> hands of the insurgents would be a well-nigh
impossible task. Recalling the acts of those fanaticised sectarians,
one might almost recall the <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb291" href=
"#pb291" name="pb291">291</a>]</span>barbarities and brutalities of the
diabolical Nero. Certainly the ancient Chinese and Japanese were
scarcely more excessive in their treatment of the unfortunate
missionaries they tortured in their attempt to stamp out the christian
faith; and even the Chinese <i>boxers</i> of our days could have taken
lessons from the disciples of <span class="corr" title=
"Source: filipino">Filipino</span> freemasonry. Many, many are the
unfortunate missionaries whose blood cries to heaven for <span class=
"corr" id="xd26e7192" title="Source: vengance">vengeance</span> and
this <span class="corr" id="xd26e7196" title=
"Source: vengance">vengeance</span> of the God of Justice will one day
fall upon this people. Even in our own days we cannot shut our eyes to
the fact of the existence of the well marked track of the hand of
Divine Justice as it passes here and there throughout the land, calling
now upon this one, now upon that, to pay his debt even to the last
farthing. The track of the finger of God has been remarkably distinct
in this archipelago and many are the cases in which that finger moving
slowly and silently along has pointed out the unfruitful tree which the
scythe of death shall cut down.</p>
<p>&ldquo;For I the Lord <span class="corr" id="xd26e7201" title=
"Source: they">thy</span> God am a jealous God; visiting the sins of
the fathers upon the children until the third and fourth
generation.&rdquo; <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb292" href="#pb292"
name="pb292">292</a>]</span></p>
<p id="n96"><span class="sc">Note 96.</span> Some there are who see in
every event which takes place, the protecting or avenging hand of
Providence. Others there are who laugh to scorn the idea that
Providence should concern itself in such matters.</p>
<p>The hand of Providence surely has manifested itself of late in this
archipelago, here protecting the one from a cruel torture, there
permitting the <span class="corr" id="xd26e7211" title=
"Source: sacrifiece">sacrifice</span> of a martyr to the faith or a
martyr to duty and honor, and the integrity of the Spanish nation. Here
giving one over to a just punishment, there pointing out another as an
object for Divine <span class="corr" id="xd26e7214" title=
"Source: vengance">vengeance</span>.</p>
<p>Is proof needed perhaps that the finger of the avenging hand of
Divine justice has left its well-marked path in the Philippines? Then
we have a notable case before us. A few months ago, a steamer, the Rio
de Janeiro, left the Orient bound for the port of San Francisco, Cal.
Within sight of the city, almost within sight of the crowds who stood
upon the wharf in expectation of the ship&rsquo;s arrival, the good
vessel, by the will of God who rules over all things, went to the
bottom, carrying with her, among other passengers, a man who was
morally and physically <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb293" href=
"#pb293" name="pb293">293</a>]</span>responsible for the greater part
of the barbarities practiced upon the long suffering Spanish prisoners,
Religious, Civil and Military, at the hands of the Tagalog
revolutionists. With that man disappeared from the land of the living
his whole family, together with state and private papers of unknown
value. How often before in the past history of the world has the God of
Justice obliterated whole families and even whole nations!</p>
<p>And who shall say that the hand of Divine Justice has not protected
as well as avenged. For many months the katipuneros had woven a
fine-meshed net around the Spanish population of the Philippines, a
labor the more easily accomplished in the same degree as the scandalous
carelessness of the Blanco administration became more and more marked.
Blanco himself was a freemason<a class="noteref" id="xd26e7223src"
href="#xd26e7223" name="xd26e7223src">9</a> and was always, like our
present <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb294" href="#pb294" name=
"pb294">294</a>]</span>civil administration, surrounded by friends of
his own choice, people who at no time suffered from an excess of
patriotism; and the few honorable exceptions which did exist were,
unfortunately, persons whose good moral influence was powerless to
better a situation which day by day became worse<a class="noteref" id=
"xd26e7240src" href="#xd26e7240" name="xd26e7240src">10</a>.</p>
<p>This net already woven was set, and it needed but the given signal
for its string to be tightly drawn and the unsuspecting <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb295" href="#pb295" name="pb295">295</a>]</span>prey
would immediately fall into its folds, to be redeemed only by a
barbarous, cruel death. But providence is merciful as well as just, and
in her own time opened up a way of escape for the coveted prize of the
<i>katipunero</i> savages. This opening was no other than Teodoro
Pati&ntilde;o, himself a member of the diabolical society, the plot of
which he was to reveal.</p>
<p>Pati&ntilde;o was one of the many compositors in the printing
establishment of the <i lang="es">Diario de Manila</i><span class=
"corr" title="Source: ,">.</span> He was an indian of but little
importance both as regards his abilities as a workman or as a
<i>katipunero</i>: he was one of the thousands of unknowns from which
have sprung so many of those sadly famous <i lang="es">ignorantes</i>
and others of our own days. But he was destined to act an important
part in the society to which he belonged: a part however not in the
programme of proceedings drawn up by the society.</p>
<p>A <span class="corr" id="xd26e7274" title=
"Source: discusion">discussion</span> took place one day as to the
subscription the said Pati&ntilde;o should pay into the common funds of
the society, and heated words passed between him and his companions on
the subject. From words they came to blows; and as Pati&ntilde;o was
one against many he came out of the <span class="corr" id="xd26e7277"
title="Source: tussel">tussle</span> <span class="pagenum">[<a id=

received a good sound thrashing for daring to differ from the majority.
To satisfy his injured feelings he looked around him for some one from
whom he could expect sympathy, and he bethought himself of his sister
who was a pupil of the College of Mandaloya, under the care of the
Augustinian Nuns. To his sister he repaired and to her he told his tale
of woe, making mention at the same time of a certain society to which
he and his assailants belonged.</p>
<p>The sister startled by what her brother related, questioned him
closely, as only a woman can question when she wishes to get to the
bottom of anything. Having been a pupil of the Augustinian Nuns for a
considerable time and preserving in her heart sentiments of gratitude
little known among the peoples of the Archipelago, she was much hurt to
hear of the plans mapped out by the <i>Katipunan</i> for the brutal
destruction of those who had always been so good and kind to her and
her brother. And before Pati&ntilde;o could tell all his tale, his
sister had bidden him good-bye and gone off in search of the Mother
Superior of the College, to whom she immediately told all she knew of
the affair. The two women trembling <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"pb297" href="#pb297" name="pb297">297</a>]</span>with fear for the
safety of the lives of so many hundreds of innocent victims, hurriedly
<span class="corr" id="xd26e7289" title="Source: saught">sought</span>
the presence of the Rev. Padre Mariano Gil, Augustinian, and parish
priest of Tondo. This Rev. Father, realizing the enormity of the
<i>Katipunan</i> plot, advised them to send Pati&ntilde;o to him
without delay.</p>
<p>Pati&ntilde;o presented himself at the <i lang="es">convento</i> and
underwent a close examination at the hands of Padre Mariano. At first
little progress was made, as Pati&ntilde;o feared both the anger of the
authorities and that of his fellow <i lang="es">katipuneros</i>, who
would doubtless take revenge upon him according to the laws of the
society, for his tale-telling. And in spite of the fact that he tried
at every turn to avoid telling the naked truth, and to escape here and
there by professions of ignorance, he eventually manifested to P.
Mariano Gil all he knew of the society, of its plans and of its
resources. After a long and tedious conversation, the patriotic
Augustinian was gratified with the knowledge of where to lay his hands
upon hidden documents etc., which would throw much light upon the
purposes of the society of cut-throats. P. Gil immediately set to work
to disclose the hidden secrets. <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb298"
href="#pb298" name="pb298">298</a>]</span></p>
<p>&ldquo;Without <span class="corr" id="xd26e7307" title=
"Source: loosing">losing</span> a moment,&rdquo; writes P. Mariano Gil,
to a friend who had asked of him the true story of what took place on
that memorable occasion, &ldquo;I sent notice to the Lieut. of the
<i>Veterana</i> of this sub-division, D. Jos&eacute; Cort&eacute;s, to
whom in the presence of the denouncer, Pati&ntilde;o, I communicated
the most necessary data, giving him at the same time the names of all
those persons in the printing establishment who were compromised,
commencing with the two who signed the receipts, Policarpo Tarla and
Braulio Rivera, indicating to him the manner of procedure for the
detention of all those complicated.</p>
<p class="tb">. . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .</p>
<p>&hellip; &ldquo;I decided, confiding in God, to go alone to the
printing establishment, at a time when none of the workmen should be
present.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The writer goes on <span class="corr" id="xd26e7319" title=
"Source: the">to</span> explain how he made known his mission to D.
Ram&oacute;n Montes and two other Spaniards who, astonished at the
news, aided in the search for the documents, stones etc. After a half
hour&rsquo;s search the <span class="corr" id="xd26e7322" title=
"Source: lithograpic">lithographic</span> stone was discovered, and
like a tiger springing upon its prey, the zealous son of St. Augustine
pounced <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb299" href="#pb299" name=
"pb299">299</a>]</span>upon it, as though he feared that the very roof
of the building should fall in upon it and bury it beneath its rubbish
out of reach of his hands. A proof was taken from the said stone, of
the <i>Katipunero</i> receipts, and P. Gil immediately set off in the
direction of the <i>Veterana</i> of Tondo where he met Pati&ntilde;o,
who recognized the receipt as authentic, and two hours later the
Patriotic Augustinian saw his efforts crowned with the confession of
guilt of the delinquents, the two previously named, figuring at the
head of the list. Having performed this, P. Gil humbly wended his way
back to his parochial dwelling, satisfied to have been an instrument of
divine Providence for the unravelling of one of the most bloodthirsty
plots ever invented by the perverse mind of embruted mankind.</p>
<p>At midnight was discovered in the locker of Policarpo Tarla, in the
same place, a dagger, the regulations of the Katipunan and several
documents having connection with the said society, all of which,
together with the famous lithographic stone<span class="corr" id=
"xd26e7335" title="Not in source">,</span> were handed over by Sr.
Montes to the <i>Veterana</i>.</p>
<p>On the following day P. Gil discovered <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"pb300" href="#pb300" name="pb300">300</a>]</span>in the house of one
of his <span class="corr" id="xd26e7345" title=
"Source: parishoners">parishioners</span> a dagger identical to the one
mentioned, also several receipts in Tagalog with the key of the
symbolic language in which they were printed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;This&rdquo;, affirms P. Gil, &ldquo;is the truth of the
discovery.&rdquo;</p>
<p>There can be little doubt that Pati&ntilde;o was directly inspired
more by the thrashing he received than by providence, although it is
not possible to deny that the thrashing and the consequent divulging of
the secrets of the <i>Katipunan</i> were providential. And as regards
to his <span class="corr" id="xd26e7355" title=
"Source: repentence">repentance</span>, I doubt judging from the
character of the average indian, whether he really felt repentant till
the enormity of the crime to which he was an <span class="corr" id=
"xd26e7358" title="Source: abbetor">abettor</span> was brought home to
him by P. Mariano Gil. Be that as it may. The ways of Providence are
hidden from us and we can seldom see, with our human eyes, more than
the actions of the human reason. Yet the truth remains, that whether
directly or indirectly inspired by providence it was <span class="corr"
id="xd26e7361" title=
"Source: Patino&rsquo;s">Pati&ntilde;o&rsquo;s</span> action which
saved Spain &ldquo;from an unending series of bitter
experiences.&rdquo; <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb301" href="#pb301"
name="pb301">301</a>]</span></p>
<p id="n97"><span class="sc">Note 97.</span> What has, up to this
present, been written concerning these stirring events has been taken
chiefly from the reports made by Gen. Blanco to Sr. Canovas. Whether
from ignorance or from malice, these reports contained about as many
errors as words. From these Sr. Diaz evidently took the statement that
the sister of Pati&ntilde;o was a pupil in the College of Looban,
whereas P. Mariano Gil himself states that it was that known as the
Orphan Asylum for Girls at Mandaloya.</p>
<p id="n98"><span class="sc">Note 98.</span> The following sketch of P.
Mariano Gil is taken from the <i>Heraldo de Madrid</i> which in its
number of the 6th October 1896, said:</p>
<p>&ldquo;P. Gil was born in Carreon de los Condes (Palencia) on the
2nd of July 1849. Whilst still young he entered the Augustinian College
of Valladolid. His studies concluded, he passed to the Philippines
where he filled the duties of parish priest in several Tagalog pueblos.
Till recently he has been holding the position of parish priest of
Tondo, a suburb of Manila. He was fortunate enough to discover the plot
of the insurrection on the 19th of August last, <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb302" href="#pb302" name=
"pb302">302</a>]</span>denouncing it at an opportune moment. The
Spaniards gathered in manifestation to the palace of the Governor
General; Sr. Blanco did not condescend to receive them and they
therefore went at once to pay their respects to P. Gil and the
Archbishop, both of whom congratulated them for their patriotic
attitude. A newspaper of Manila, <i lang="es">El Espa&ntilde;ol</i>,
published the picture of the parish priest of Tondo; but scarcely had
the first copies of the paper appeared on the street, than General
Blanco ordered their suppression, commanding that a new edition be
printed omitting the said picture and the laudatory phrases which the
<i lang="es">El Espa&ntilde;ol</i> had dedicated to the eminent
Augustinian, from this time a note-worthy patriot to whom the public
did a justice which General Blanco either did not know how, or did not
wish to do him.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Speaking of this patriotic Padre, Sr. Castillo y Jimenez<a class=
"noteref" id="xd26e7388src" href="#xd26e7388" name=
"xd26e7388src">11</a> says:</p>
<div class="figure mgilwidth"><img src="images/mgil.gif" alt="" width=

<p>&ldquo;His character is gruff; he asks nothing, he demands; he does
not beseech, he asks; and what he demands and asks is just and lawful,
because it bears in its essence the <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"pb303" href="#pb303" name="pb303">303</a>]</span>benefit of mankind,
aiding the unfortunate, warding off their dangers, delivering them from
the attacks which envy and <span class="corr" id="xd26e7398" title=
"Source: vengance">vengeance</span> might deal out to pacific and
humble people. He is inflexible with the reprobate and disloyal,
magnanimous with those who have been deceived; proud with the haughty
and humble with the weak, and in his generous life has wiped away many
tears, distributed much bread to the poor, and many times proportioned
assistance to the needy that they should not fall into want.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The good work done in the discovery of the diabolical plot of the
<i>Katipunan</i>, has very naturally been the object of a great amount
of bitter criticism at the hands of the <span class="corr" id=
"xd26e7406" title="Source: seperatist">separatist</span> element, which
has never pardoned the valiant Augustinian for springing their
carefully laid traps<span class="corr" title="Source: ,">.</span> He
was denounced in the lodge rooms of <span class="corr" title=
"Source: filipino">Filipino</span> freemasonry, from one of which was
despatched a letter directed to him and bearing his picture, as will be
seen in the accompanying illustration. His discovery was depreciated
and belittled, and made to appear a farce. His patriotism was called
into question and his very life was placed in imminent danger.
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb304" href="#pb304" name=
"pb304">304</a>]</span></p>
<p>However the torrents of lies that have poured forth against him have
not, and can not obliterate the truth.</p>
<p>Isabelo de los Reyes to belittle the labors of discovery of
P<span class="corr" title="Not in source">.</span> Gil, affirms that
Antonio Luna notified Blanco of the existence of the association
previous to the discovery of P. Gil. Be that as it may; the secret
police had also notified Blanco of what was going on<span class="corr"
id="xd26e7423" title="Source: ;">.</span> Three times did the
Archbishop of Manila do the same, and so also did the other prelates of
Manila and Prior of the Convent of Guadalupe, and Lieut.
Sityer<a class="noteref" id="xd26e7426src" href="#xd26e7426" name=
"xd26e7426src">12</a>. But this does not lessen the value of Padre
Gil&rsquo;s discovery, but rather adds to its importance. For whilst
Blanco was sufficiently posted on the matter to be able to judge of the
necessity of taking immediate proceedings, <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb305" href="#pb305" name=
"pb305">305</a>]</span>there was wanting that healthy stimulus which
was given by P. Gil. A stubborn carbuncle often needs the aid of the
lance: P. Gil&rsquo;s discovery was the lance which brought to the
surface the putrid matter which nature could not, of herself, eject.
This putrid matter extending itself, would have brought about the
mortification of the whole body, had not the surgeon applied his lance
in good time. And although the lance of the surgeon brought pain to the
patient it saved her for the time, giving back to her a state of
relative health.</p>
<p id="n99"><span class="sc">Note 99.</span> The first executions which
took place were those of four rebels captured <i>in <span class="corr"
id="xd26e7443" title="Source: fraganti">flagrante</span></i> in San
Juan del Monte. These were Sancho Valenzuela, Eugenio Silvestre,
Modesto Sarmiento and Ram&oacute;n Peralta. Of these Valenzuela was the
only one of any importance. Sarmiento was a <i lang="es">cabeza de
barangay</i><a class="noteref" id="xd26e7448src" href="#xd26e7448"
name="xd26e7448src">13</a> of Santa Ana where he owned a small
<i>nipa</i> house which he rented out, performing at the same time the
office of cook and house boy to the tenant. <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb306" href="#pb306" name="pb306">306</a>]</span>On
the way to execution he met his tenant-master and, in a nonchalant
manner, greeted him with as pleasant a <i>Buenos dias Se&ntilde;or</i>,
as if he were on the way to some joyous function or a grand
&ldquo;meet&rdquo; at the cock-pit. Before his execution Valenzuela
also showed a spirit of coolness and serenity, signing his last will
and testament with a firm hand, and smiling. Both showed the spirit of
men thoroughly <span class="corr" id="xd26e7460" title=

"xd26e7463" name="xd26e7463"></a>, neither realizing the crime they had

<p>The second execution took place in Cavite, thirteen rebels being
shot. These were Francisco Osorio<span class="corr" id="xd26e7467"

title="Source: halfcaste">half-caste</span>. He had been honored by
Spain with several honors, among them the Grand Cross of Carlos III. He
was very intimate with the <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb307" href=
"#pb307" name="pb307">307</a>]</span>authorities in Cavite. His father,
a wealthy <span class="corr" id="xd26e7488" title=
"Source: chinee">Chinee</span>, and his cousin, a doctor, both
denounced him at the moment of his execution.</p>
<p>&ldquo;After the reading of the sentence,&rdquo; says an
eye-witness, &ldquo;in front of the square which we formed, he
commenced to cry, asking pardon of the General and of all Spaniards; he
affirmed that he was a Spaniard and that he would never conspire again
against the country in which he had been educated, and he cursed the
freemasons who in Madrid had initiated him into the hatred of religion
and the fatherland. The doctor his cousin, turning to him, said:
<i>Silence Osorio! <span class="corr" id="xd26e7495" title=
"Source: dont">don&rsquo;t</span> cry so; what will the Spaniards
benefit from your repentance</i>; but the miserable fellow paid no
attention to him, and asked to be allowed to kiss the Spanish flag
before he died. This permission was not granted.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Maximo Inocencio was the proprietor of a large store and was a
contractor to the Arsenal. He had been previously arrested for
implication in the revolt in Cavite in 1872. At that time he escaped
but was afterwards pardoned; the signal rocket was to be fired from his
storehouse in Cavite.</p>
<p>Luis Aguado was also a contractor for the Arsenal. <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb308" href="#pb308" name="pb308">308</a>]</span></p>
<p>Victoriano Luciano, a chemist, was a wealthy half-caste who had not
lived long in Cavite.</p>
<p>Hugo P&eacute;rez, was an <i lang="es">indio</i>. He was the
venerable of the masonic lodge. In his house were discovered two large
photographs in which the majority of the thirteen persons executed were
photographed in the form of a triangle; a book with a triangle and
other masonic insignia on its front page, and four important letters of
anti-Spanish masonic propaganda.</p>
<p>Lallana was a tailor, and some say a peninsular Spaniard. For a
while he was chief of police of Cavite and had been a corporal of
Marines.</p>
<p>Antonio San Agustin was an indian, a petty merchant and a man who
could scarcely bear the sight of a Spaniard.</p>
<p>Agapito Conchu was a master of a primary school, and a half-caste.
He had once been detained in the time of Despujols but granted his
liberty. Apart from his school, he gave lessons to some of the children
of the Spanish families of the town, including the daughter of the
Governor of Cavite.</p>
<p>Cabuco was an <i lang="es">escribiente</i><a class="noteref" id=

watch-tinker.</p>
<p>These executions were followed by that of a member of the Guardia
<i>Civil</i>, Mariano Magno, in Nueva Ecija. Magno had always been
noted for his lack of obedience to his superiors, his hatred of
discipline and ill-feeling in general towards Spaniards. Fifteen others
were shot in Iligan on the 28th of October of the same year. Many
others suffered the like penalty in different parts of the
Archipelago.</p>
<p id="n100"><span class="sc">Note 100.</span> Those sentenced to
deportation were, for the most part, sent to Jolo, Puerta Princesa,
Balabac and to the penitentiary colonies.</p>
<p>To the first named place were sent 69 persons of all kinds and
conditions, trades and occupations. Among them was a Juan Cuadra, a
chemist in Ermita. To Puerta Princesa went 53, and to Balabac 56 both
lots well assorted. Those most compromised in the insurrection were
sent to Fernando Poo, these numbering some 200. Three hundred more were
sent to Mindanao. Among the 200 sent to Fernando Poo were merchants,
compositors, silversmiths, book-binders, <span class="pagenum">[<a id=

<p id="n101"><span class="sc">Note 101.</span> Apolinario Mabini was
born in the pueblo of Tanauan, province of Batangas, and was the son of
parents of the poorer and lower classes. He came to Manila as a lad and
received his <span class="corr" id="xd26e7689" title=
"Source: secondry">secondary</span> education in the College of San
Juan de Letran at the hands of the Dominican Fathers, taking the degree
of professor. Later on he was employed in the <i lang=
"es">Intendencia</i> and by <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb311" href=
"#pb311" name="pb311">311</a>]</span>careful saving and by steady
application he continued his studies for law and concluded his course
at the University of Santo Tomas also at the hands of the Dominicans
who spared no efforts on behalf of his success. From the University he
received the title of <span class="corr" id="xd26e7697" title=
"Source: Licenciate">Licentiate</span> of Law in 1895.</p>
<p>He entered the office of the notary Numeriano Adriano to practice
law, and whilst there employed, was drawn by Adriano into the net of
masonry, joining the lodge Balagtas which was one of those founded from
the <span class="corr" id="xd26e7702" title=
"Source: everflow">overflow</span> of the original <span class="corr"
title="Source: filipino">Filipino</span> lodge <i>Nilad</i>. Adriano
was the <i>venerable</i> of the said <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"pb312" href="#pb312" name="pb312">312</a>]</span>lodge. When the
<i>Liga Filipina</i> was formed and had gotten well into working order
Mabini was named a councillor of the superior Council (see page 28).
According to the testimony of Moises Salvador (see page 296) Mabini was
also secretary of the Association of <i>Compromisarios</i>.</p>
<p>He was arrested as one of the chief instigators of the revolt and
after due trial was sentenced to death. The Spanish authorities
however, took compassion upon him because of his pitiful condition, he
being paralysed in the lower parts of the body<a class="noteref" id=
"xd26e7725src" href="#xd26e7725" name="xd26e7725src">17</a>; so instead
of including his name in the list <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb313"
href="#pb313" name="pb313">313</a>]</span>of those who expiated their
treason on the field of Bagumbayan, they foolishly gave him his
liberty.</p>
<p>Once more free, Mabini left Manila for his own <i>pueblo</i> of
Tanauan where he lived quietly till Aguinaldo was brought over in 1898
by Admiral Dewey to serve as a bush-beater to the American forces.
Mabini was thereupon carried from Tanauan to Cavite where he joined the
faithless <i>Magdalo</i>.</p>
<p>In Cavite he drew up a project of a constitutional law for the
Philippines. In the first page of this he affirmed that the precepts of
the Ten Commandments were <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb314" href=
"#pb314" name="pb314">314</a>]</span>an invention of the friars! And
yet Mabini was the <span class="corr" title=
"Source: filipino">Filipino</span> Solomon. He instructed the people
that they ought not to believe in the said decalogue or practice what
it commanded, but that they should only practice the precepts of the
<i lang="es">Verdadero Dec&aacute;logo</i> which he prepared and gave
to the public as their spiritual guide.</p>
<p>Mabini very soon became radical and decidedly anti-American in his
ideas, and succeeded in attaining such moral <span class="corr" id=
"xd26e7754" title="Source: ascendency">ascendancy</span> over Aguinaldo
that the latter ceased to be the leader of the people and the true
dictator of the <span class="corr" title=

"pagenum">[<a id="pb315" href="#pb315" name="pb315">315</a>]</span>a
toy in the hands of a man who could twist and turn him here and there
at his will.</p>
<p>Mabini refused to take the oath of allegiance and was, on the 7th of
January 1901 deported under General Order No. 4 to the island of Guam,
as one of the persons &ldquo;whose acts clearly <span class="corr" id=

favorers or sympathizers with the insurrection.&rdquo;</p>
<p id="n102"><span class="sc">Note 102.</span> The advanced political

themselves; no particular objection <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"pb316" href="#pb316" name="pb316">316</a>]</span>can be raised against
them as political ideas. But when we consider by whom and for whom
these &ldquo;reforms&rdquo; were asked, we begin to appreciate the
necessity to which the indian was put of endeavoring to attain them by
armed struggle. Taking away the revolutionary basis upon which the
plans of the <i>Liga</i> were raised, nothing remains but the empty
walls of a roofless building. These walls or ideas are contained in the
plans of reforms drawn up by almost every jackanapes in the <i>Liga</i>
who could write down his thoughts with any amount of clearness. These
plans agreed upon certain <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb317" href=
"#pb317" name="pb317">317</a>]</span>points, chiefly representation in
the Spanish parliament and the expulsion of the Religious Orders. These
two points appear to have been the essence of the direct aims of the

<p>Others called for the Spanish constitution with its consequences:
the liberty of the press and the liberty of associations. Liberty of
the press was ever an unknown quantity in the Philippines. The idea of
the liberty of the press is very beautiful when its liberties are not
abused; it was the abuse of what little liberty the press enjoyed, in
the latter days of Spanish rule, that induced the <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb318" href="#pb318" name=
"pb318">318</a>]</span>authorities to impose such a close censure upon
it as they did. Whatever may be said in its favor, press censorship and
such sedition laws as we enjoy to-day in this nondescript piece of the
world&rsquo;s surface, are more proper of absolute monarchies than of
territory of the U. S. of America, although in our particular case we
might as well be under the despotic, ever deteriorating rule of
Aguinaldo, as that of a body of men whose intentions however good and
sincere they may be, fall short, when put into practice, of the
proverbial ingenuity in governing, of the famous Sancho Panza in his
<i>island</i> of Barataria. Freedom of the <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb319" href="#pb319" name=
"pb319">319</a>]</span>press is at times a blessing, and at others a
curse. From 1888 to 1896 it would have been more of the latter than of
the former; for giving such a liberty to the <span class="corr" id=
"xd26e7800" title="Source: seperatists">separatists</span> who asked
it, would be arming the enemy with the best arms.</p>
<p>As to liberty of associations. People in the Temperance world often
ask themselves, does prohibition prohibit? Some <i>make</i> themselves
believe that it does; but practice has shown what common sense tells
each and every one of us, that it does not; for if a man (and I do not
wish to be so ungallant as to exclude the ladies) cannot get what he
wants legally, he as a rule sees that he gets it somehow. And so with
the <span class="corr" title="Source: filipinos">Filipinos</span> who,
denied the liberty of association, defied the authorities and held

<p>All these various political ideas were decidedly <i>advanced</i> in

them. No father would put a loaded revolver or an open <span class=

to 1896 Aguinaldo was an almost unknown <i lang="es">indio</i>. He was
at that time about 23 or 24 years of age, and like the far greater
majority of the <i lang="es">indios</i> of the archipelago had
forgotten what little he had learned at school. He was a
lavandero<a class="noteref" id="xd26e6763src" href="#xd26e6763" name=
"xd26e6763src">2</a> for the Arsenal at Cavite, and possessed little
command over the Spanish <span class="corr" id="xd26e6766" title=
"Source: laguage">language</span>, speaking it after the Cavite style,
<i lang="es">de cocina</i> as the Spaniards say. He was the son of
Carlos Aguinaldo who had several times held office under the Spanish
Government, and who was at heart a bitter anti-Spaniard. Like the
remainder of his fellow Tagalogs, Aguinaldo demonstrates a different
character in connection with each event which takes place in his life.
As <i lang="es">capitan municipal</i> in 1896 he was very Spanish in
dealing with the authorities, but in dealing with his own people quite
the reverse. Like the Taveras, the Legardas and the Buencaminos etc.,
he was an adept at political lightning changes. Buencamino in one of
his absurd articles to the <span class="corr" title=
"Source: filipino">Filipino</span> press (<span lang="es">La
Independencia</span>, Sept. 6th 1896) speaking of him says:
<span class="corr" id="xd26e6782" title=

title="Source: filipinos">Filipinos</span> unconditionally obey the
president Aguinaldo seeing in him the messenger of God sent to redeem
the <span class="corr" title="Source: filipino">Filipino</span> people
from all foreign domination, and because they see in the said chief the
great virtues of fortitude, honor and magnanimity which ought to adorn
all saviors of their country.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="footnote cont">The belief among some <span class="corr"
title="Source: filipinos">Filipinos</span> that Aguinaldo was a
semi-God was not uncommon at one time, and many hold to it even in
these days. A certain Bray (apparently related very closely to the bray
of an ass) went a step further in an article to the <span class="corr"

Alexander the Great, to Mahomet, to <span class="corr" id="xd26e6807"
title="Source: Caezar">Caesar</span>, to Napoleon and others!</p>
<p class="footnote cont">Aguinaldo certainly demonstrated fortitude,
and did not sell his sword to those he considered his enemies. His
misfortune was that he fell into the hands of such advisers as
Buencamino and others, who, after working up his stupid pride, deserted
him in his hour of need. Aguinaldo showed fortitude and was never a
traitor to what he considered the honor of his country. Honor to

<p class="footnote cont">&ldquo;Notice is hereby given of the

and Echaluce in regard to the same.</p>
<p class="footnote cont">&ldquo;This freemason, Juan Merchan, says:
&ldquo;we are now sleeping; we cannot work; we are tutored by the
experience of the persecution directed against us by General Echaluce.
Until General Blanco returns from Mindanao we can do nothing, for he at
least does not disturb us, and even helps us. The proof of this is that
during the previous voyage to Mindanao (of Blanco) Gen. Echaluce
commenced<a id="xd26e7249" name="xd26e7249"></a> to deport people; but
when Blanco got to know of it, he wrote to him ordering him not to

H. Poblete: a <i lang="es">pobre diablo</i> who speaks Spanish like a
chino and writes it far worse. Poblete is greatly devoted to
cock-fighting; but being as reckless <span class="corr" id="xd26e7555"
title="Source: it">in</span> the enjoyment of this sport as he is in
everything else he undertakes, he finds his pocket always more or less
empty. To fill this pocket he is ever hunting up schemes to make money
in the easiest way possible. The subscription lists he has started for
various pious or patriotic objects are well nigh innumerable.</p>
<p class="footnote cont">The <i lang="es">Heraldo de Madrid</i>, of the
19th of November 1896, says of this charlatan:</p>
<p class="footnote cont">&ldquo;Well paired with Tom&aacute;s del
Rosario, the <i lang="es">indio</i> who, by literary fraud gained from
Se&ntilde;or Nu&ntilde;ez de Arce a good position in the Philippines,
is Pascual H. Poblete also an <i lang="es">indio</i><a class="noteref"
id="xd26e7572src" href="#xd26e7572" name="xd26e7572src">16</a> and a
person of history too.</p>
<p class="footnote cont">&ldquo;His first steps in work in the
newspapers of his country were as translator of the Spanish text of a
bilingual review into Tagalog.</p>
<p class="footnote cont">&ldquo;He propagated political themes widely,
but above all, those articles of the Civil and Penal code favorable to
his countrymen; to these articles he added comments&#8202;&hellip;.
Under the pretext of competing with the Chinese he founded a
cooperative association which was the subject of much talk. It was
really nothing else than an association distinctly political and
eminently anti-Spanish. He however <span class="corr" id="xd26e7587"
title="Source: suceeded">succeeded</span> in dissimulating, and when he
created the newspaper <i lang="es">El Resumen</i>, placed a peninsular
<span class="corr" id="xd26e7593" title=
"Source: Spanniard">Spaniard</span>, a native of Aragon, at its head.
He then did all he could to gain the confidence of Despujols, whom he
visited every once in a while.</p>
<p class="footnote cont">&ldquo;As Despujols step by step lost favor
with the European element, Poblete praised him more and more and this
was, in itself, a good sign of the direction in which was going this
Poblete, a man lacking talent, lacking wit, and enjoying nothing but an
insane intention. During the last years he made continuous anti-Spanish
propaganda, and was a bitter enemy of the Spaniards, excepting some few
degenerates who yet believed in the good faith of this <i lang=
"es">pobre diablo</i>.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="footnote cont">In later days he changed his
religion&mdash;that is if he ever had one to change, and devoted
himself to sponging upon the Bible Societies and the protestant and
Mormon missionaries who came to the Philippines. On one occasion he
<i>translated</i> from Spanish into Tagalog the Holy Scriptures, and
seeing that never in his life had he been a successful translator even
of newspaper paragraphs, but could only succeed in giving little more
than a very general idea of what was contained in the Spanish text, it
was not to be wondered at that, as a famous literary critic well versed
in the Tagalog once said: &ldquo;Poblete&rsquo;s Tagalog bible reads
more like a badly written chronicle than a version of the sacred
Scriptures. If I thought that our Lord and his Apostles preached and
taught what Poblete puts into their mouths, I would go to China and
become a disciple of Confucius.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="footnote cont">In the latter days of Spanish rule Poblete was
always more or less under the eyes of the authorities, and on the
17th<a id="xd26e7612" name="xd26e7612"></a> of April 1896 the Secret
Police asked of General Blanco the necessary permission to search the
houses of several highly suspicious people, among them that of Pascual
H. Poblete.</p>
<p class="footnote cont">Our hero figured at one time as an expert in
the raising of subscriptions for monuments and if I am not very much
mistaken, he once had a hand in the raising of money for the coming
monument to Rizal the hero and martyr of the <i lang="es">Filipino
Libre</i> party. It would be very interesting to know what became of
all the funds that passed through his hands: the majority apparently
went to back his favorite birds at the cock-pits.</p>
<p class="footnote cont">Since the American occupation Poblete&rsquo;s
chief enterprise, apart from cock-fighting and &ldquo;sponging upon the
<i lang="es">ignorantes</i> who listened to his ravings with more or
less favor because he was a protestant, was the editing and publishing
of a dirty little &ldquo;sheet&rdquo; known as the <i lang="tl">Ang
Kapatid nang Bayan</i>.&rdquo; In this so called newspaper Poblete
aired his radical political ideas with such vigor that the Provost
Marshal was compelled to call him down. The <i lang="es">pobre
diablo</i> then turned his attention to another pastime which would
combine the advantages of demonstrating his <span class="corr" id=
"xd26e7634" title="Source: insurpassable">unsurpassable</span>
abilities, of airing his opinions and, last mentioned but of the
greatest importance, the quality of putting into his pocket a goodly
number of easily <span class="corr" id="xd26e7638" title=
"Source: eared">earned</span> dollars. This pastime took the shape of a
theatrical enterprise: Constancia, the daughter of the said mountebank
&ldquo;composed and wrote&rdquo; a play entitled <i lang="tl">Ang Pag
Ibig Sa Lupang Tinubinan</i>: For the Love of Country. <span class=
"corr" id="xd26e7644" title="Source: Poblete,s">Poblete&rsquo;s</span>
better half (which is not saying much) played the part of the heroine.
The whole play was incendiary in the extreme and the audience being
<span class="corr" id="xd26e7647" title=
"Source: tagalogs">Tagalogs</span> of the lowest and most ignorant
class, the result was that they were thrown into a state of the
greatest frenzy. Poblete put this play on the boards of the <i lang=
"es">Teatro Oriental</i>. All went well in the first acts; and
following out the &ldquo;plot&rdquo; of the play, the town of Imus was
supposed to have been taken by the rebels. Dramatic shouts of <i lang=
"es">Viva La Independencia</i>; were raised from time to time by the
actors, followed by shouts from the audience of <i lang="es">Viva
Filipinas! Viva Aguinaldo!</i> Suddenly there rushed from the
&ldquo;wings&rdquo; a gaudy looking creature who ought to have been the
Tondo market selling cockles and crabs; this turned out to be the
heroine. In one hand she held a revolutionary flag and in the other a
<i>bolo</i>. <span lang="es">Viva La Independencia</span> was the shout
which almost raised the roof; but as fate would have it Poblete was
doomed to be humbled to the dust. Just as he was promising himself a
fine string of dollars from his new enterprise Capt. Lara and a number
of police appeared on the scene, and Poblete, his katipunan banners and
bolos etc., were seized and the house cleared of its fanatical
occupants.</p>
<p class="footnote cont">To-day he amuses himself in fitting out bands
of little boys who on &ldquo;state&rdquo; occasions parade the streets
with American flags and Japanese lanterns, and placards with various
inscriptions, the chief ones being petitions for an amnesty on behalf
of all those who have &ldquo;done what they ought not to have
done&rdquo;. Poblete would open the doors of the prisons of the
Archipelago and let loose all their occupants. The result? A political
boom for Poblete, an increase in the membership of the <i lang=
"es">Partido Nacionalista</i> and an increase of crime to a thousand
fold, not only in Manila but throughout the whole archipelago.</p>
<p class="footnote cont">Poor Poblete a <i lang="es">pobre infeliz</i>,
a stain upon the good name of the filipino. But then, what would

<p class="first">Under the title of &ldquo;My part in the
Revolution,&rdquo; Isabelo de los Reyes <span class="corr" id=

himself before those who considered him a coward because of his ever
shirking that part of the task of the revolt which naturally fell to
him, gives his readers the following information:</p>
<p>&ldquo;When it was desired to effect the <span class="corr" id=
"xd26e7946" title="Source: manifestacion">manifestation</span> of 1888,
(see p. 60), Ramos took me to the palace of Malaca&ntilde;an, to
express to Gen. Terrero verbally the complaints of <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb324" href="#pb324" name="pb324">324</a>]</span>the
&ldquo;country&rdquo;; but I do not know why, but on that day the
<span class="corr" id="xd26e7951" title=
"Source: manifestacion">manifestation</span> did not come
off&#8202;&hellip;.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;From the palace of Malaca&ntilde;an we went to the house of
Doroteo Cortes, who instructed me in the object of the manifestation,
thus:</p>
<p>&ldquo;&hellip; We reckon with the pleasure of the Civil Governor
Sr. Centeno (see note 2) to make a manifestation against the friars,
who oppress us with their abuses, and oppose the progress of the
country.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;&mdash;Very good indeed I replied full of enthusiasm.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But my enthusiasm disappeared entirely when Cortes told me
with the greatest frankness, that they asked and were sure of attaining
their wish, that the Archbishop should be deported, merely for having
failed to assist at the religious functions dedicated to the
King<a class="noteref" id="xd26e7962src" href="#xd26e7962" name=
"xd26e7962src">1</a>. <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb325" href=
"#pb325" name="pb325">325</a>]</span></p>
<p>&ldquo;I then doubted the ability<a class="noteref" id=
"xd26e7985src" href="#xd26e7985" name="xd26e7985src">2</a> of the
directors of the manifestation, and believed that they would be
<span class="corr" id="xd26e7988" title=
"Source: irremissably">irremissibly</span> crushed by the friars, who
were very astute and powerful, as in fact it so happened.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I retired leaving Ramos in that house.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I immediately went to see his father and said to him: The
manifestation has fallen flat. I have come to tell you that in my
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb326" href="#pb326" name=
"pb326">326</a>]</span>opinion, your son ought not to sign the instance
of the <span class="corr" id="xd26e7997" title=
"Source: manifestors">manifestos</span>. Let all those who like do so,
but it would be a pity that your son who, in the time to come, may be
able to render signal services to the country should now fall crushed
by the friars. Now that Cort&eacute;s says that he reckons with the
authorities, your son&rsquo;s signature is not very necessary.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And neither Cort&eacute;s nor Ramos signed it.&rdquo;</p>

considerable time from <span class="corr" id="xd26e7968" title=

the official relations at that time between the civil and
ecclesiastical authorities had completely incapacitated the venerable
prelate from attending to his official duties. Consequently, acting
upon the advice of his physician, the Archbishop left Manila for
Navotas for a few days of complete rest. The departure of the
Archbishop happened to almost coincide with the anniversary of the
death of the King; but as the prelate was physically unable to attend
to the pontifical ceremonies which were to be held on that day and to
the other functions consequent upon such a solemn occasion, he was
wisely advised to absent himself from the city.</p>
<p class="footnote cont">Freemasonry ever on the watch, saw in this an
opportunity to attack the Religious Orders, and taking advantage of it,
demanded: &ldquo;The insult committed by the archbishop being therefore

And when the <i lang="es">La Pol&iacute;tica de Espa&ntilde;a en

highest point, embracing the desire to discover the author or authors

even though the form and details are unknown.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The presidency of the Cons&there4; Reg&there4; has not been

himself in the house of Sr. Marte, gr&there4; 3, late <span class=

he would report the matter to General Blanco, and the extraction of the

<p class="first"><i>Anting-antings</i> constitute the remnants of what
was once, what might be called the religion of the peoples of the
Philippines. They are most commonly met with in the form of amulets
which their possessors carry about with them to ward off dangers of all
kinds. There are amulets for protection against fire arms, against
sword thrust or <i>bolo</i> slash; against diseases of all parts of the
body; amulets against the bursting of fire arms or to prevent them
making a noise when discharged by the wearer of the amulet; against
snakes and their bites, against <span class="corr" id="xd26e8107"
title="Source: lighting">lightning</span>; amulets to <a id="xd26e8110"
name="xd26e8110"></a>protect their wearers against the courts of
justice and against the authorities when they <span class="corr" id=
"xd26e8112" title="Source: persue">pursue</span> them for robbery. In a
word amulets or <i>anting-anting</i> against everything.</p>
<p>As a rules these amulets consist of small booklets containing
prayers composed of Latin and Spanish words mixed with words
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb331" href="#pb331" name=
"pb331">331</a>]</span>and <span class="corr" id="xd26e8122" title=
"Source: abreviations">abbreviations</span> of the native dialects.
Some times they are stones or mineral deposits found in the bodies of
animals, or the seed portion of petrified fruits, or even parts of the
skeletons of children.</p>
<p>Although one would suppose that such superstitions had long since
ceased to exist among the indians of the archipelago such is not the
case; and it is more than probable that the majority of the members of
the federal party and may be two out of the three native members of the
Commission carry their anting-anting carefully guarded in one of their
pockets. However their use is most common among native doctors, that is
those who have not studied <span class="corr" id="xd26e8127" title=
"Source: medecine">medicine</span>, but who dabble in the art for what
they can get out of it, and by <i lang="es">tulisanes</i> or armed
robbers. They were also much in vogue among the <i>enlightened</i>
officers and men of the insurgent ranks, many of whom considered
themselves perfectly safe from the bullets of their enemies when they
carried in their person an amulet or <i>anting-anting</i>.</p>
<p>The following are samples of pages of one of the booklets found on
the person of a wounded <i lang="es">tulisan</i>. The first of these
two pages contains <span class="corr" id="xd26e8144" title=
"Source: an">a</span> prayer against fire-arms, <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb332" href="#pb332" name="pb332">332</a>]</span>and

<p><i>Anting-anting</i> is also found in other forms, sometimes merely
a strip of paper bearing some inscription, and which receives its
virtue from some action performed over it, such as the saying of the
mass whilst the paper is on the altar.</p>
<p>A parish priest of a pueblo in a neighboring province once related
to me the discovery of one such an <i>anting-anting</i> in his church.
He approached the altar to recite the Mass, and upon genuflecting at
the centre of the altar <span class="corr" id="xd26e8198" title=
"Source: notice">noticed</span> that there was something unusual,
although small, under the altar cloth. He put his hand under the cloth
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb333" href="#pb333" name=

paper bearing three crosses, thus:</p>

<p>This paper had been carelessly folded and placed where he found it,
upon the altar stone. Had it remained undisturbed and the service of
Mass been said over it, it would have, in the belief of the indian who
put it there, become infused with <span class="corr" id="xd26e8214"
title="Source: marvellous">marvelous</span> virtues and could have
protected its wearer from the dangers to be incurred in the armed
rising against the Spaniards which they were about to attempt.</p>
<p>In all probability Buencamino carried some <i>anting-anting</i> with
him to Washington to protect him from <span class="corr" id="xd26e8222"

<p>This curious little book is one continuous rant against the
Katipunan movement, which stood at the roots of the First Philippine
Republic. It also calls the original native population of the
Philippines barbarians that imitate in an ape-like fashion, and claims
that some Philippine languages do not have the words to say
&ldquo;thank you.&rdquo; It is highly negative on Jos&eacute; Rizal and
masonry as well.</p>
<p>Published in Manila in 1902, it is one of the few of its kind in
English (similar works did appear in Spanish and Tagalog). Another book
supporting the position of the friars, but far less extreme in tone is
<i><a class="pglink xd26e45" title="Link to Project Gutenberg ebook"
href="https://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/36438">The Friars in the
Philippines</a></i> (1899) by Ambrose Coleman.</p>
<p>In an article on the Katipunan published in a masonic magazine,
<i>The Builder Magazine</i>, February 1916, James A. Robertson provides
a little background on the author.</p>
<blockquote>
<p class="first">In Blair &amp; Robertson, <i>The Philippine Islands:
1493&ndash;1898</i> (Cleveland, Clark, 1903&ndash;1909), Vol. 46, p.
361, note, I cite this pamphlet, (<i>The Katipunan</i>, Manila, 1902),
and say of its author &ldquo;purporting to be by one Francis St. Clair,
although it is claimed by some to have been written by or for the
friars.&rdquo; Its author is really one J. Brecknock Watson, who is an
Englishman and a convert to Catholicism. At the time of its
publication, Watson was in the employ of, or was actually a lay-brother
among, the Dominicans, for whom the pamphlet was compiled. The author
himself told me that he was &ldquo;Francis St. Clair&rdquo; shortly
after my arrival in Manila in February, 1910, when I went to the
Philippines to take charge of the Philippine Library. James A. LeRoy,
until his death one of the foremost authorities on things Philippine,
says in his &ldquo;Bibliographical Notes&rdquo; (vol. 52, p. 188 note,
of the series above cited) that the pamphlet was &ldquo;published in
order to put before Americans the friar viewpoint of the Filipino
revolutionists.&rdquo; The work is, as might be expected, ultra
anti-Masonic in character, and consists of translations into English
from Spanish writers who were opposed to Masonry. By the enemies of
Masonry, the Katipunan has often been designated &ldquo;the fighting
body of Masonry&rdquo; in the Philippines, a statement which is as
ridiculous as it is erroneous. &ldquo;Francis St. Clair,&rdquo; at
present an editor on the staff of the Cablenews-American, is writing
another book on the Katipunan (this time under his own name) from
materials which he claims to have discovered. The book will be
anti-Masonic in tone.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>He continues to classify the work as &ldquo;utterly
untrustworthy&rdquo; and provides a short history of masonry in the
Philippines and its connection with the Katipunan.</p>
<p>The other book on the Katipunan mentioned above apparently never saw
the day of light.</p>

<p class="first">The large number of spelling mistakes in this work
have been corrected and listed below, except for turned letters, which
have been corrected silently. (The type-setters obviously avenged
themselves for being called ignorant in this book.)</p>
<p>Where periods have been used as thousands-separator, they have been
replaced by commas.</p>
<p>Long stretches of periods have been normalized to regular
ellipses.</p>
<p>Capitalization of names of peoples has been regularized, such that
Spaniards and Filipinos now both have a capital letter.</p>
<p>The symbol &there4; (U+2234) is used to indicate abbreviations.</p>
