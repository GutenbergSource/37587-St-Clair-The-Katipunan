</p><p>This curious little book is one continuous rant against the Katipunan movement, which stood at the roots of the First Philippine Republic. It also calls the original native population of the Philippines barbarians that imitate in an ape-like fashion, and claims that some Philippine languages do not have the words to say &#8220;thank you.&#8221; It is highly negative on Jos&#233; Rizal and masonry as well.
</p><p>Published in Manila in 1902, it is one of the few of its kind in English (similar works did appear in Spanish and Tagalog). Another book supporting the position of the friars, but far less extreme in tone is <hi><xref url="pg:36438">The Friars in the Philippines</xref></hi> (1899) by Ambrose Coleman.
</p><p>In an article on the Katipunan published in a masonic magazine, <hi>The Builder Magazine</hi>, February 1916, James A. Robertson provides a little background on the author.


    <q rend="block"><p>In Blair &amp; Robertson, <hi>The Philippine Islands: 1493&#8211;1898</hi> (Cleveland, Clark, 1903&#8211;1909), Vol. 46, p. 361, note, I cite this pamphlet, (<hi>The Katipunan</hi>, Manila, 1902), and say of its author &#8220;purporting to be by one Francis St. Clair, although it is claimed by some to have been written by or for the friars.&#8221; Its author is really one J. Brecknock Watson, who is an Englishman and a convert to Catholicism. At the time of its publication, Watson was in the employ of, or was actually a lay-brother among, the Dominicans, for whom the pamphlet was compiled. The author himself told me that he was &#8220;Francis St. Clair&#8221; shortly after my arrival in Manila in February, 1910, when I went to the Philippines to take charge of the Philippine Library. James A. LeRoy, until his death one of the foremost authorities on things Philippine, says in his &#8220;Bibliographical Notes&#8221; (vol. 52, p. 188 note, of the series above cited) that the pamphlet was &#8220;published in order to put before Americans the friar viewpoint of the Filipino revolutionists.&#8221; The work is, as might be expected, ultra anti-Masonic in character, and consists of translations into English from Spanish writers who were opposed to Masonry. By the enemies of Masonry, the Katipunan has often been designated &#8220;the fighting body of Masonry&#8221; in the Philippines, a statement which is as ridiculous as it is erroneous. &#8220;Francis St. Clair,&#8221; at present an editor on the staff of the Cablenews-American, is writing another book on the Katipunan (this time under his own name) from materials which he claims to have discovered. The book will be anti-Masonic in tone.</p></q>
</p><p>He continues to classify the work as &#8220;utterly untrustworthy&#8221; and provides a short history of masonry in the Philippines and its connection with the Katipunan.
</p><p>The other book on the Katipunan mentioned above apparently never saw the day of light.

    <q rend="block"><p><hi>Vast organization of secret societies discovered with anti-national tendencies.</hi>

    </p><p><hi>Twenty-two persons detained, among them the Gran Oriente (of Philippine freemasonry) of the Philippines, and others of importance.</hi>

    </p><p rend="class(signed)">&#8212;<hi rend="sc">Blanco.</hi></p></q>

</p><p>Such was the telegram sent by Gen. Blanco and read by Sr. Castellano in the Spanish Camara, announcing the discovery of <pb id="pb8" n="8"/>the revolutionary movement headed by the Katipunan, the bastard child of Filipino freemasonry.
</p><p>Freemasonry in the Philippines was but a pretext: under this pretext the <corr sic="ememies">enemies</corr> of Spain, in days of Spanish rule, and the enemies of the U. S. in these days of American rule, put themselves into close and secret communion, to earn out plans of revolt.
</p><p>This <corr sic="filipino">Filipino</corr> masonry cast its net far and wide, and in its meshes were caught many fish of all classes and conditions; some of them men of money who <corr sic="saught">sought</corr> in masonry what money could easily purchase,&#8212;honors and titles, grand crosses and medals; others were men whose pockets were more or less replete, and whose aims were of a great variety of natures; whilst others were men whose treasuries were more or less empty and who <corr sic="saught">sought</corr> in masonry what they did not care to earn by honest labor&#8212;a livelihood.
</p><p>Masonry was imported into the Archipelago, shortly after the Spanish Revolution, and was, during the first years of its life, confined to Spaniards; but later on it opened its doors to half-castes and indians. In 1887 it extended by leaps and bounds; but <pb id="pb9" n="9"/>upon the coming of Gen. Weyler to the Archipelago, as Governor General, in 1888, it dwindled away almost into nothingness. Gen. Weyler was, and has ever shown himself, a patriotic Spaniard; and he would not permit the existence here, under his Governorship, of anything which tended to the detriment of his country. Well did the masons of the Philippines and elsewhere know this, and hence the vicious and cruel campaign they carried on against him both in the Peninsular and Cuba, but more especially in the U. S. of America.
</p><p>The Katipunan, the bastard child of filipino masonry, that ungrateful offspring which was unfaithful even to the mother which brought it forth, was a society within the bosom of which was redeveloped the malay instinct which had lain dormant for some three centuries. This instinct, brutal, savage, intensely ignorant, immoral, ungodly; an instinct found still among some of the uncivilized tribes of the mountain fastnesses of Luzon; an instinct once almost blotted out after many years of most difficult labor and self-sacrifice on the part of the Religious Orders, once again burst forth in all its strength.
<pb id="pb10" n="10"/></p><p>The indian left to himself, deprived of the curbing influence of the christian religion, speedily falls back into the condition of depravity in which Urdaneta and Legazpi found him. The malay instinct, like the volcano, vomits forth when least expected; the history of the revolt of the Tagalogs gives overabundant proof of it. Take one by one the many leading characters in the revolution, and the instinct will be found so plainly marked, that it is <corr sic="unmistakeable">unmistakable</corr>. Take for instance Marcelo H. del Pilar, in whose brain was conceived the plot of the Katipunan farsical-tragedy; Andr&#233;s Bonifacio, whose duty was the materializing of the plot; the Lunas, Juan especially, who had some time previous, in Paris, given an example of how easily the <hi>malay</hi> burned through the <hi>veneer</hi> of civilization to which the <corr sic="filipino">Filipino</corr> indian is susceptible; and so on, including the Aguinaldos, the Mabinis, the Agoncillos and even many of those, who in these days boast in public of their americanist ideas, and in private plot with treacherous zeal to overthrow the government of those they call their deliverers from Spanish tyranny. In them all may be traced the strange instinct of the old time filipino <pb id="pb11" n="11"/>indian. Entering the fold of freemasonry, they threw off the bridle of religion which restrained them; loosing respect for Almighty God and for their faith they soon lost respect for others and for themselves. The result is well known<corr sic=",">.</corr> History, the history of the last five or six years, has shown it to us.
</p><p>It is of this society of <hi>notables</hi>&#8212;for such is the meaning of the full title of the Katipunan&#8212;that I wish to say a few words in the following pages. I have taken as a foundation for my study, a very concise statement of the whole situation, drawn up by Capt. Olegario Diaz, Commander of the Guardia Civil Veterana de Manila. This document being an official statement, is of vital interest in the study of the birth, life and internal corruption of that diabolical association which, gigantic though it was, comparatively speaking, could, by reason of its infantility, have been easily stifled, had it been dealt with, with a strong hand. I have taken the document as a base, and by a series of notes in the form of a somewhat more lengthy appendix, have endeavored to provide my readers with a file of interesting items of historical value.
<pb id="pb12" n="12"/></p><p>This pamphlet is not intended to be a history of the rebellion; I have endeavored to confine myself to the society which brought about the revolt, and if at any time I have strayed from the path I laid out for myself, it has been because there was by the wayside some flower I wished to pluck to add to the bouquet I herewith present to you.

Olegario Diaz<note n="1">The numbers which will be found throughout this document signify notes to be found in the appendix. The letters in brackets signify footnotes of minor importance.</note></head><div2 type="Section"><head>Freemasonry</head><p>It is fully proved that freemasonry has been the principal factor for the development in these islands, not only of advanced (<ref target="n2">2</ref>) and anti-religious ideas, but chiefly for the foundation of secret societies, possessing a character especially separatist (<ref target="n3">3</ref>). This conviction I have come to after the examination of a countless number of documents, and the much correspondence this Corps (<ref target="n4">4</ref>) fell in with, after laborious work and <pb id="pb14" n="14"/>investigations, in the possession of several well known filibusters (<ref target="n5">5</ref>) who are at the present time prisoners; these documents and parcels of correspondence were included in the military suit tried before Colonel D. Francisco Olive (<ref target="n6">6</ref>).
</p><p>&#171;Some 20 years ago, there was installed in this country, a lodge dependent upon the Gr&#8756; Or&#8756; Espa&#241;ol (<ref target="n7">7</ref>): a lodge which was inoffensive in its beginning because it was composed of peninsular Spaniards, with the absolute exclusion of the native element of the <corr sic="Archipielago">Archipelago</corr>. In this form it developed languidly until the year 1890.
</p><p>&#171;During this epoch, the <corr sic="filipino">Filipino</corr> colony resident in Madrid, <corr sic="Hongkong">Hong-Kong</corr> and Paris, in the which figured as exalted separatists Jos&#233; Rizal (<ref target="n8">8</ref>), Marcelo H. del Pilar (<ref target="n9">9</ref>), Graciano Lopez, Mariano Ponce, Eduardo Lete, Antonio and Juan Luna (<ref target="n10">10</ref>), Julio Llorente, Salvador V. del Rosario, Doroteo Cort&#233;s (<ref target="n11">11</ref>), Jos&#233; Baza, Pedro Serrano (<ref target="n12">12</ref>), Mois&#233;s Salvador, Galicano Apacible and many others, who were in communication with the seditious elements of Manila, strove hard to <corr sic="infuence">influence</corr> don Miguel Morayta (<ref target="n13">13</ref>), (Grand master of the Oriente Espa&#241;ol), in Madrid, and with whom they sustained close <pb id="pb15" n="15"/>relations, to the end that the statutes should be reformed so that the native element might be affiliated, and even more, that lodges of a character exclusively Tagalog (<ref target="n14">14</ref>), might be created in the Archipelago. Conferences, general gatherings, and finally compromises of certain magnitude decided in the favor of the <corr sic="filipinos">Filipinos</corr>, Morayta thus, unconsciously sowing the seed, the fruit of which we are to-day gathering.
</p><p>&#171;D. Alejandro Roji, resident in this capital, Captain of Engineers, was nominated general delegate to direct the works, and with ample powers from Morayta, came the native school-teacher Pedro Serrano, who enjoyed in Manila the confidence and protection of the said Colonel, assisted by the Flores, lieutenants of Infantry, Numeriano Adriano, Ambrosio Rianzares, Juan Zulueta, Faustino Villaruel (<ref target="n15">15</ref>), Agustin de la Rosa, Ambrosio Salvador, Andr&#233;s Bonifacio<corr sic=", (16)"> (<ref target="n16">16</ref>),</corr> Apolinario Mabini (<ref target="n17">17</ref>), Estanislao Legaspi Domingo Franco (<ref target="n18">18</ref>), Rom&#225;n Basa, Deodato Arellano, Antonio Salazar, Felipe Zamora, Nazario Constantino, Bonifacio Arevalo, Pedro Casimiro, Dionisio Ferraz, Timoteo Paez and a thousand others, all indians, but having a career or a comfortable <pb id="pb16" n="16"/>social position; they commenced a silent and tenacious propaganda which resulted in 180 <corr sic="tagalog">Tagalog</corr> lodges, extended throughout the territory of Luzon and part of the Bisayas, being constituted in 5 years. The character of the native (<ref target="n19">19</ref>), so propitious to all the mysterious and symbolic, easily accustomed itself to the ridiculous practices of freemasonry: the initiations (<ref target="n20">20</ref>), the proofs (<ref target="n21">21</ref>), the oaths (<ref target="n22">22</ref>), attributes, signs and pass words, and the pseudonyms, all and everything surrounded by shade and mystery, appealed to the native and served him as an educative ladder which prepared his mind for his entry into other associations of graver transcendencies, according as the initiators and apostles of filibusterism, Rizal, Pilar, L&#243;pez, Cort&#233;s and Zulueta had forseen, as can be proved by that correspondence which has come to my hands.
</p><p>&#171;In order to direct the organization of the lodges dependant upon the Gran Oriente Espa&#241;ol, there was constituted by Morayta, a Gran Consejo Regional (<ref target="n23">23</ref>) which received its instructions from him, and which was presided over by Ambrosio Flores (h&#8756; Muza), and formed of Adriano, Villaruel, Flores (A), Mabini, Paez, Zamora, <pb id="pb17" n="17"/>Mariano and Salazar. The newspaper <hi>La Solidaridad</hi> (<ref target="n24">24</ref>) which, in the previous year had been founded in Barcelona by M. Pilar, as a delegate of the propaganda of Manila, and the publishing centre of which was later on translated to Madrid, was declared the official organ of all <corr sic="filipino">Filipino</corr> masonry; and in its <corr sic="colaboration">collaboration</corr>, all the <corr sic="filipinos">Filipinos</corr> of a medium culture resident in the capital, took a hand, under the <corr sic="auspicies">auspices</corr> and direction of its new proprietor, the oft-mentioned and ill-starred Morayta.
</p><p>&#171;In 1893 the <foreign lang="es" xml:lang="es">Gran Oriente Nacional</foreign>, of which the Grand Master is Sr. Pantoja, reporter of the highest tribunal of justice, conceded powers to the lieutenant military councillor Sr. Lacasa, and the sergeant of Infantry, Jos&#233; Martin, to carry on propaganda in these islands among the native element, and in competition with the other Oriente. The result did not correspond to the efforts of the propagandists, who only succeeded in creating some few lodges in the Capital, in Cavite, Cagayan, Iloilo and Negros. How could it be expected to prosper, when the Gran Oriente Espa&#241;ol had already catechized the masses of the country!
</p><p>&#171;It must be declared, although it makes <pb id="pb18" n="18"/>one blush to do so, that many peninsular Spaniards, and among them some holding important official positions in the country, have contributed to this propaganda, scandalous, and from all points of view, aimed at the integrity of the nation (<ref target="n25">25</ref>). Only candor can exculpate them. May the country pardon them.
</p><p>&#171;From the first moments, both in the organ of <corr sic="filipino">Filipino</corr> freemasonry, <hi lang="es" xml:lang="es">La Solidaridad</hi>, and in the circulars which the Gran Oriente sent to Spain for the information of the brethren there resident, was commenced a coarse and shameless campaign against the Monastic Orders (<ref target="n26">26</ref>), and of scoffing and ridicule of religion. Later on, this campaign acquired a political character, attacking the government of the metropolis, and the authorities of the archipelago, demanding liberal reforms for the country, such as representation in the Cortes, the colonial C&#225;mara, municipal autonomy, increase of individual rights etc. etc., Let anyone with half an eye examine carefully the collections of the cited paper, and he will certainly meet with something contrary to the national unity, artfully and modestly hidden. Let him read the almost <pb id="pb19" n="19"/>countless number of documents (<ref target="n27">27</ref>) pertaining to the Tagalog lodges, and sent by me to the judge, Se&#241;or Olive, which were united to the charges, and the most incredulous will be convinced that the lodges and their aids and abettors devoted themselves to something more than the propaganda of freemasonry. <hi>There is not a single one of the chiefs and organizers of the filibuster organizations up to this time discovered, who is not a freemason.</hi>&#187;

</p></div2><div2 type="Section"><head>&#171;<foreign lang="es" xml:lang="es">La Propaganda</foreign>&#187; and the &#171;<foreign lang="es" xml:lang="es">Asociacion Hispano-Filipina</foreign>.&#187;</head><p>At the end of the year 1888, Marcelo del Pilar, a lawyer of Bulac&#225;n, and a frenetic filibuster, considering himself in peril of deportation in consequence of juridical proceedings formed against him in the said province, decided to translate his residence to Spain, under the shelter of a certain element of the country (<ref target="n28">28</ref>). In those days was created in Manila a committee of propaganda (<ref target="n29">29</ref>) formed by Doroteo Cort&#233;s, Ambrosio Rianzares Bautista, Pedro Serrano and Deodato <corr sic="Arrellano">Arellano</corr>, under the presidency of the first named, its mission being the gathering from among the better class <pb id="pb20" n="20"/>and more wealthy element, funds for the propagation throughout the Archipelago, of all classes of pamphlets and proclamations written to depreciate and cast slurs upon the Monastic Orders (<ref target="n30">30</ref>), and upon Religion; and likewise for the <corr sic="implantion">implantation</corr> in the country democratic doctrines; finally the nomination was agreed to of a delegation which should depend directly upon the committee recently constituted, and which should have its residence in Barcelona, its duty being to make overtures to the public authorities for the concession to the <corr sic="Archipielago">Archipelago</corr> of greater liberties and of representation in the Cortes in the first place. And in order to sustain and defend these ideals together with some few more, the foundation was authorized of a bi-monthly newspaper.
</p><p>&#171;The committee of propaganda fully fulfilled its mission; it overcame all the wealthy element of Luzon (<ref target="n31">31</ref>), gathered grand quantities, and Marcelo del Pilar set off for the Peninsular, installing himself <corr sic="confortably">comfortably</corr> in the &#171;Ciudad Condal&#187; <note n="a">Barcelona.</note> at the expense of his countrymen (<ref target="n32">32</ref>).
</p><p>&#171;In January 1889, he commenced the campaign <pb id="pb21" n="21"/>in union with his companion of the delegation Mariano Ponce. They founded the paper <hi lang="es" xml:lang="es">La Solidaridad</hi> and constituted the Hispano-Filipino association, into which were drawn a large number of the native students residing in Barcelona<note n="a">About this same time a lodge composed of <corr sic="filipinos">Filipinos</corr> was formed in Madrid, and known as the <hi lang="es" xml:lang="es">Solidaridad</hi>. There it was that steps were taken to catechize the masses of the <corr sic="filipinos">Filipinos</corr> in their own homes<corr>.</corr></note>. The committee made great progress in Manila, added to the number of its followers and collected funds in return for subscriptions to <hi lang="es" xml:lang="es">La Solidaridad</hi> which, day by day, had more readers; it distributed books, pamphlets and proclamations of the worst class, for which a good price was collected.
</p><p>&#171;The association had increased hand over hand; its aspirations (<ref target="n33">33</ref>) were most radical; and considering its action limited in Barcelona, it determined to translate its headquarters to Madrid, where it would have a wider field for its pretensions. About this same time Serrano, Rizal, Luna, L&#243;pez etc., were united to the delegation and they succeeded in implanting <corr sic="tagalog">Tagalog</corr> masonry in their country (<ref target="n34">34</ref>), and from this <pb id="pb22" n="22"/>precise moment, commenced their relations with Morayta.
</p><p>&#171;In January 1890 the &#171;<foreign lang="es" xml:lang="es">Asociacion Hispano-Filipina</foreign>,&#187;<note n="a">In the Official Bulletin of the Gr&#8756; Or&#8756; Esp&#8756; for Sept. 1896, Morayta, speaking of this association of separatists said: &#8220;It was born strong,&#8212;the filipino colony numbered then more than 70 members, by the side of whom labored several peninsular Spaniards.&#8221; It is a pity Morayta did not classify these peninsular Spaniards, for had he done so we might perhaps have found among their number some of the social <corr sic="outcastes">outcasts</corr> who have since aided the insurgent element against the legitimate authority of the United States.</note> the delegation, and the paper <hi>La Solidaridad</hi> were installed in Madrid. Morayta accepted the presidency of the Association and became proprietor of the newspaper from which such good results were expected, it counting with an increased output to supply enforced <corr sic="suscriptions">subscriptions</corr> among masons and their <corr sic="associaties">associates</corr> at the rate of a peso a head.
</p><p>&#171;From that moment Morayta was made the idol of the turbulent indians, who considered him <corr sic="has">as</corr> their redeemer; no one is ignorant of the labors undertaken by the said personage in Spain, both in the realms of journalism and around and about the <pb id="pb23" n="23"/>powers that be, on behalf of the securing representation in the Cortes, the liberty of association (<ref target="n35">35</ref>) and that of the press, municipal autonomy and even under a hidden guise, of that of the colony; in the memory of all is preserved the remembrance of the banquet given by the <corr sic="filipinos">Filipinos</corr> inspired by Morayta, to Sr. Labra, the autonomist deputy for Cuba, and no one has forgotten the proposition presented to the Congress by Sr. Junoy, the republican deputy, also inspired by the Association and the delegation presided over and protected by Morayta. And who finally, does not feel indignation upon calling to mind the articles published in <hi>La Solidaridad</hi> by the <corr sic="filipinos">Filipinos</corr> Kalipulako (M. Ponce), Jaena (G. Lopez), Dimas-Alang (Jos&#233; Rizal), Eduardo Lete, Taga-Ilog (Antonio Luna), Juan Totoo (J. Zulueta) and Kupang or Maitalag&#225; (M. del Pilar)?
</p><p>&#171;What Spaniard is not fired to anger, upon reading the books and pamphlets written by Rizal, Luna and Lopez and the infinite number of printed libels which circulate here full of falsities and loathsome calumnies against the most sacred and venerated, the Fatherland? Have we forgotten, perhaps, Dr. Blumentritt (<ref target="n36">36</ref>) who repaid our most <pb id="pb24" n="24"/>generous hospitality by making common cause with our enemies? Do we not call to mind, peradventure, that all the filipino colony in Spain and a good portion of that here resident, sympathised with that ungrateful man, conferring upon him the honor of <corr sic="banquetting">banqueting</corr> him and extending to him their congratulations?
</p><p>&#171;Fortunately these labors obtained no practical result in the peninsula (<ref target="n37">37</ref>), but they caused the native element of some amount of culture to <corr sic="habour">harbor</corr> imaginary ills and want of confidence in the Metropolis, covert discontent with the authorities of the islands (<ref target="n38">38</ref>), and finally, sowed the seed of aspirations which could never be realized<note n="a">These aspirations almost all turned upon the idea of independence. The ability of the natives to govern themselves has had many tests. During the last days of Spanish rule a taste of this <corr sic="privelege">privilege</corr> in minor grade was allowed the native as a test, and it needed but a drop of the independence <corr sic="ticture">tincture</corr> to put the patient into a burning fever. It truly takes a visionary to claim for the <corr sic="filipino">Filipino</corr> the ability to govern his own country. In the <corr sic="filipino">Filipino</corr> family the woman &#8220;wears the breeches&#8221; and in the pueblo all is subservient to the &#8220;boss&#8221;, the presidente. The aspirations of the pre-American <corr sic="filipinos">Filipinos</corr> are the same as the aspirations of the Federal Party: aspirations which can never be realized till the character of the aspirant radically changes. &#8220;Filipinas&#8221; yet awaits in expectation to find the <corr sic="filipino">Filipino</corr> who can govern his own household!</note>. <pb id="pb25" n="25"/>but a seed which is to-day, unfortunately, bearing fruit.
</p><p>&#171;A casino of recreation known as the Centro Filipino, was also organized in Madrid: a revolutionary club was the only thing to which that center could be compared. There Spain was <corr sic="discused">discussed</corr>, <corr sic="criticised">criticized</corr> and slandered under the shelter of the law of association which prevails in the Peninsula, and shielded by the hypocrisy and deception so proper of cowards.
</p><p>&#171;Personal rivalries and the want of morality in the administration of the funds (<ref target="n39">39</ref>) remitted from Manila by the committee of propaganda, gave rise to a grave disagreement between the two apostles of filipino filibusterism, Rizal and Pilar; with the former sided the young and impetuous element; with the latter the mature and thoughtful (<ref target="n40">40</ref>). Both elaborated the same material, but each using a different process; the one boldly insolent and hostile, the other masked with <corr sic="hypocricy">hypocrisy</corr> and calm. Both being ambitious, each found the world too small to contain him. This state of things ceased with the coming of Rizal to these islands in 1892 (<ref target="n41">41</ref>), Pilar remaining the absolute possessor of the field at Madrid.
<pb id="pb26" n="26"/></p><p>&#171;In the meanwhile the committee of propaganda was not inactive. It created delegations throughout the <corr sic="archipielago">archipelago</corr>, and by their means introduced the <hi>La Solidaridad</hi> and all kinds of revolutionary printed matter into the utmost corners of the <corr sic="archipielago">archipelago</corr>.

</p></div2><div2 type="Section"><head>The &#171;<foreign lang="es" xml:lang="es">Liga Filipina</foreign>&#187;</head><p>&#171;Rizal, magnanimously pardoned by His Excellency the Captain General of the <corr sic="Archipi&#233;lago">Archipelago</corr>, D. Eulogio Despujol (<ref target="n42">42</ref>), after the making of a thousand and one lying protests of repentance, reached this capital in May 1892, being received by his countrymen with extraordinary proofs of enthusiasm and rejoicing; and converting himself into an apostle of filibusterism, commenced a campaign of scandalous propaganda.
</p><p>&#171;Three days after his arrival he convoked a large reunion (<ref target="n43">43</ref>) in the house of the <corr sic="chinese">Chinese</corr> half-caste Ongjungco in Tondo, and under his presidentship there gathered Franco, property owner; Flores, Lieutenant of Infantry; Rianzares, lawyer; Zulueta, government employee; Adriano, notary; Reyes, tailor; Paez, business agent; Francisco, industrial; <pb id="pb27" n="27"/>Serrano, school-teacher; A. Salvador, contractor; Salazar, industrial; Mariano, property owner; Legaspi, industrial; Jos&#233;, property owner; Bonifacio, warehouse porter; Plata, <hi>curial</hi>; Villareal, tailor; Rosa, book-keeper; Arellano, military employee; M. Salvador, industrial; Ar&#233;valo, dentist; Rosario, merchant; Santill&#225;n, industrial; Ramos, industrial; Joven, property owner; Villaruel, merchant; Mabini, lawyer; Nacpil, silversmith; and many other <corr sic="filipinos">Filipinos</corr> well known by their ideas. To this assembly Rizal made known the motive which had inspired him to call it together, which was no other than the creation of a secret society to be known as the &#171;Liga Filipina&#187;, founded for the purpose of fomenting the advancement and culture of the country and the attaining, later on, of emancipation from Spain (<ref target="n44">44</ref>). He read out a list of provisional regulations drawn up by himself; these regulations were unanimously approved; a commission formed of Ambrosio Salvador and Deodato Arellano as president and secretary respectively, was at once nominated for the studying and development of Rizal&#8217;s project, and the reunion was <corr sic="disolved">dissolved</corr> till it should be again convoked.
<pb id="pb28" n="28"/></p><p>&#171;The opportune deportation of Rizal (<ref target="n45">45</ref>), Cortes and Salvador, upset the plans of the &#171;oath bound&#187; conspirators and the panic thus brought about dispersed them for the moment. In the beginning of the year 1893 they <corr sic="reassumed">re-assumed</corr> the work (<ref target="n46">46</ref>), sometimes in the house of Domingo Franco, and at others in that of Deodato Arellano; and after it had been agreed that they should be ruled by the regulations of Rizal, and votes having been cast, the Supreme Council of the &#171;Liga&#187; was constituted in the following form:

</p><p>&#171;Before continuing, and in order that the facts which follow may be better understood, I will give some idea of the &#171;Liga&#187; according to the mentioned regulations. <pb id="pb29" n="29"/>Its determined ends (<ref target="n47">47</ref>), were the independence of the islands; its means, the propaganda of advanced political ideas (<ref target="n48">48</ref>), availing themselves of conferences, books<corr>,</corr> pamphlets and the paper &#171;La Solidaridad&#187; which was declared the official organ of the association; the culture of the country by means of study, and its material advancement by stimulating the creation of large enterprises and industries; and, as a final means, armed rebellion (<ref target="n49">49</ref>). The catechised or initiated <corr sic="submitied">submitted</corr> themselves to a solemn oath before a human skull, which they afterwards kissed, signing with their own blood (<ref target="n50">50</ref>) a compromising document, after making the corresponding incision in one of their arms.
</p><p>&#171;All those initiated incurred the duty of making propaganda (<ref target="n51">51</ref>) by all means in their power, and of increasing the number of the associates, of preserving under severest penalties, the most impenetrable silence on all matters relating to the &#171;Liga&#187; and blind obedience to their superiors. The association was governed by a Supreme Council with residence in Manila, and composed of a President, a Treasurer, a Fiscal, a Secretary and twelve Councillors; for the <pb id="pb30" n="30"/>Peninsular and Hong-Kong, the delegations composed of Marcelo del Pilar and Ildefonso Laurel<note n="a">The executive committee of the Liga was composed of Moises Salvador, Ambrosio Flores, Apolinario Mabini, Domingo Franco, Numeriano Adriano, Timoteo Paez, Ambrosio Rianzares Bautista, and the brothers Venancio and Alejandro Reyes. Testimony of Antonio Salazar. (fols. 1118 to <corr sic="11.29">1129</corr>).</note>.
</p><p>&#8220;In each province was formed a provincial council with the same organizations as the Supreme Council, but with only six councillors, who, in their turn, had under their orders as many popular councils as there should be pueblos in the province in which the council should be constituted. The popular councils with analogous organization to the provincial councils, had jurisdiction within the <corr sic="demarkation">demarcation</corr> of a pueblo; they depended directly upon the respective provincial council and the provincial upon the Supreme.
</p><p>&#8220;All the members of the Supreme Council were to constitute in the capital of Manila a popular council formed of their converts within the zone of their residences; and all the members had to <corr sic="recrute">recruit</corr> among the natives of some culture, till the society should be thoroughly developed.
<pb id="pb31" n="31"/></p><p>&#8220;Each treasurer collected a <hi>peso</hi> as entrance fee from the initiated and a medio (half) peso, as a monthly subscription for each member. With the said funds there was created a central deposit in the treasury of the Supreme Council, for the covering of the expenses of the delegations, and the sustainment <corr sic="af">of</corr> the <hi>Solidaridad</hi>; and it was agreed that once there should be sufficient capital, great enterprises, of a nature undetermined, should be undertaken.
</p><p>&#8220;The eternal question of money in this class of organizations (<ref target="n52">52</ref>) gave rise to a serious falling out between Rizal and the <hi>Liga</hi> (<ref target="n53">53</ref>), on which account their official relations were severed. The subscriptions were badly collected, and those encharged with the custody and turning in of what few funds did exist misapplied them (<ref target="n54">54</ref>); this was what brought about the <corr sic="decadescence">decadence</corr> of the league and the cause of its falling into discredit and disrepute and for its not prospering, in spite of the fact that among those who aided it with their moral and metalic aid, but without formal or written compromise (<ref target="n55">55</ref>), were a number of shameless filibusters, so much the more repugnant as the brilliant social position they held under <pb id="pb32" n="32"/>the protection of Spain was elevated. Among many others may be cited the wealthy proprietors Pedro and Francisco Roxas<corr sic=", (56)"> (<ref target="n56">56</ref>),</corr> Mariano Linjap, Telesforo Chuidian, Luis R. Yangco, Antonio and Juan Luna, Felipe Zamora, Eduardo Litonjua, Marcelino de los Santos, M&#225;ximo Paterno (<ref target="n57">57</ref>) and Nazario Constantino (<ref target="n58">58</ref>).
</p><p>&#8220;Of the members of the Supreme Council, only the following succeeded in forming popular councils: Estanislao Legaspi who organized one in Tondo, known as <hi>Talang Bakero</hi>; Andr&#233;s Bonifacio, one in Trozo, known as <hi>Mayon</hi>; and Francisco Nacpil, one in Santa Cruz, known as <hi>Mactan</hi> (<ref target="n59">59</ref>). The rest of the members of the Supreme Council only succeeded in forming the following fruitless sections: Flores, one in Ermita and Malate; Zulueta in Binondo; Rianzares in San Nicol&#225;s; Francisco in Quiapo; Adriano and Mabini in Sampaloc and Nagtajan, and Salvador in Pandacan.
</p><p>&#8220;In the provinces also the <hi>Liga</hi> enjoyed such slow progress, that it was not possible to organize to popular councils, but sections only, and these were organized in the Laguna, by Vicente Reyes; in Batangas by Felipe Agoncillo (<ref target="n60">60</ref>); in Nueva Ecija, Bentus <pb id="pb33" n="33"/>and Natividad; in Tarlac the notary del Rosario, and in Bulac&#225;n, Pampanga and other provinces wealthy persons of the same. In <corr sic="fine">time</corr>, there was not a <corr sic="filipino">Filipino</corr> of wealth or career or of medium social position, who did not pertain to, or aid and abet the <hi>Liga</hi>, apart from a few most honorable exceptions (<ref target="n61">61</ref>) which it pleases me to recognize.
</p><p>&#8220;At the commencement of the year 1894 and when the league had reached the age of one year, the members agreed to the dissolution of the society, both on account of the discords which continually sprung up in its bosom, and for the fear of discovery by the authorities which had already perceived something of the goings on (<ref target="n62">62</ref>). A grand assembly of the leaders was called together and it was determined to gather in as many documents as had been drawn up or circulated, and make a bonfire of them, so that all compromising indications should be made to disappear. The society became dissolved but it took a form more hypocritical. The popular councils re-entered the masonic lodges, and these took up the work of the <hi>Liga</hi>, a thing very easy to accomplish, when we remember that there was not a single member of the society who was not a freemason.
<pb id="pb34" n="34"/></p><p>&#8220;There remained however, as a living remembrance of the <hi>Liga</hi>, a committee formed of the lawyer Numeriano Adriano and Deodato Arellano (a brother-in-law of Pilar) president and secretary, who had at their orders some 20 or 30 members from among the most important of the <corr sic="difunct">defunct</corr> <hi>Liga</hi> and who were known under the name of the <hi lang="es" xml:lang="es">compromisarios</hi> (<ref target="n63">63</ref>). These enjoyed no special organization and worked with almost entire independence. Their mission was the propagation of the <hi lang="es" xml:lang="es">La Solidaridad</hi> and the gathering of funds for the sustainment of the paper, and of the delegations in the Peninsula and elsewhere, with which they sustained active political correspondence. The work was continued with greater cunning by the lodges and by the <hi lang="es" xml:lang="es">compromisarios</hi>; and they succeeded in keeping alive the spirit of protest in a good part (the most influential) of the native element till the end of the year 1895.
</p><p>&#171;About this time the populous empire of China was defeated by the Japanese, and the Japanese Empire, having won the laurels of victory so easily, began to consider the weaving of a net of preponderance in the Occident. The <corr sic="filipinos">Filipinos</corr> who followed <pb id="pb35" n="35"/>with interest and satisfaction our contrarieties in Cuba, considered the occasion <corr sic="propicious">propitious</corr> for the Empire of the Rising Sun to copy in these islands the conduct of the Americans in the Antilles. Japan became the fashion in the Archipelago and its inhabitants were chosen as models of culture (<ref target="n64">64</ref>), wealth, of liberty and strength. They sighed for their protection and assistance, and to the attaining of it they uselessly directed their efforts. Doroteo Cort&#233;s emigrated to Yokohama (<ref target="n65">65</ref>), and with him Ramos, Baza, Espa&#241;ol and others, where they established a separatist committee in correspondence with that of Manila. Marcelo del Pilar prepared to leave Madrid to join them, but died suddenly in Barcelona and finally the foolish political schemers dreamed of the liberation of Rizal (<ref target="n66">66</ref>) who had been deported to Dapitan, in order that he also should follow Cort&#233;s and the others. From Manila there departed frequently parties of wealthy <corr sic="filipinos">Filipinos</corr> who went to Japan under the pretext of making recreative, instructive or artistic voyages, but in reality to conspire, and it is assured that they were listened to by some of the official element of that <pb id="pb36" n="36"/>nation (<ref target="n67">67</ref>). The Japanese corvette <hi>Kongo</hi> (<ref target="n68">68</ref>) arrived in Manila in the month of May and no one could explain its sudden appearance in the bay; but on the other hand the officers were mysteriously <corr sic="banquetted">banqueted</corr> by a commission of <corr sic="filipinos">Filipinos</corr> in the <hi>Bazar Japones</hi> (<ref target="n69">69</ref>) where they lodged. Causalities perhaps, but....

</p><p rend="align(center)"><hi>Supreme Society of the Sons of the People<note n="(1)"><p>The words <hi>Supreme Society</hi> express the idea of <hi>supreme social situation</hi>, of a society formed of noteworthy people. A well-read writer on the subject of &#8220;<foreign lang="es" xml:lang="es">El Katipunan &#243; el filibusterismo en Filipinas</foreign>,&#8221; says, speaking of this union of such notable folk: &#8220;<hi>A reunion of people who meet to concoct assassinations, cannot be a reunion of noteworthy people but should rather be called a reunion of noteworthy criminals.</hi>&#8221; There is not the shadow of a doubt that this is the best and, in fact, the only title to which such a society as the katipunan can justly lay claim.
<pb/></p><p>Opinion is divided as to the origin of the word katipunan, and as to the manner in which it should be written. Some spell it with C whilst the majority use K. As to the derivation: the root word is undoubtedly <hi lang="tl" xml:lang="tl">Tipon</hi> which, prefixed with the particle <hi lang="tl" xml:lang="tl">ca</hi> and terminated with <hi lang="tl" xml:lang="tl">an</hi> gives us a word, which signifies <hi>very select association</hi>. The word is however generally written with K so as to be in keeping with the <corr sic="tagalog">Tagalog</corr> way of spelling, as they (that is to say the &#8220;<hi lang="es" xml:lang="es">redimidos</hi>&#8221;<corr>)</corr> have taken to the use of K for C whenever C has a hard sound as in cat. In like manner, to the insurgent and his sympathisers, Cavite should be Kawite. The K and W are Blumentrittisms, i. e. of German descent.</p></note>.</hi>
</p><p>Whilst Rizal, in Manila, was engaged in the organization of the &#8220;Liga Filipina&#8221; into <corr sic="the "/>which only the well-to-do or educated classes could enter (<ref target="n70">70</ref>), an attempt <pb id="pb38" n="38"/>which, for that time, failed on account of his immediate deportation, Marcelo H. del Pilar, from Madrid, in July 1892, advised the creation of another association, which was to be similar thereto, but which was to include the agricultural laborers and persons of little or no education and instruction (<ref target="n71">71</ref>), but who directed in the localities by the caciques and chiefs, were to form an enormous nucleus which should, at the proper time, give forth the cry of rebellion. He (Pilar) provided minute instructions concerning the organization and forwarded a project of regulations.
</p><p>&#8220;Deodato Arellano (brother-in-law of Marcelo), Andr&#233;s Bonifacio, Ladislao Dina and <pb id="pb39" n="39"/>Teodoro Plata where those commissioned to carry into practice the project of Pilar (<ref target="n72">72</ref>); they discussed the regulations and added to them making them still more terrifying, agreeing that they should all immediately proceed with the preparatory works, and they were not interrupted till the conspiracy was discovered on the 19th of August of this year (1896). Both the said organizers and the others who composed the first Supreme Council, belonged to the &#171;Liga filipina&#187;.
</p><p>&#8220;The organization given to the society was <corr sic="analogeous">analogous</corr> to that enjoyed by the &#171;Liga&#187; (<ref target="n73">73</ref>) but amplified to the extent of anarchism, swearing hatred and destruction to everything of a character or nature Spanish (<ref target="n74">74</ref>), and sowing the seed of a race-hatred which has developed to a great extent (<ref target="n75"><corr sic="76">75</corr></ref>). The Supreme, the Provincial and the popular Councils, the sections and the delegations ruled this horrible association. The first governed the whole <corr sic="tagalog">Tagalog</corr> Katipunan (<ref target="n76">76</ref>); the second, that corresponding to a pueblo and the sections were sub-divisions or fractions into which the popular councils were divided. Those commissioned to form sections were called delegations, and whilst <pb id="pb40" n="40"/>they remained unconstituted, they depended directly upon the Supreme Council. Every associate paid an entrance fee of a <hi>medio peso</hi>, and a monthly subscription of a <hi>real</hi>. The collections were made by the respective treasurers and passed into the central treasury of the Supreme Council. The funds so gathered were utilized for the succor of the brethren in their afflictions and sicknesses, for the covering the expenses of the works of propaganda, and for the secret acquisition of fire and other arms (<ref target="n77">77</ref>).
</p><p>&#171;As in freemasonry, the initiations (<ref target="n78">78</ref>) were performed with a <corr sic="wealh">wealth</corr> of the ridiculous, and with unending <corr sic="extravagancies">extravagances</corr>; but of such a nature, that the ignorant indian was fascinated and became converted into a slave of his oath.
</p><p>&#171;The initiated were masked (<ref target="n79">79</ref>) as also was the person to be initiated; before a table was placed a skull and crossbones, a triangle and two candles; the person about to be initiated was told that the object of the Katipunan<note n="a">See note <ref target="n49">49</ref>.</note> was the liberating of the <corr sic="tagalog">Tagalog</corr> people, and the expulsion of the Spaniards from the archipelago, or their <pb id="pb41" n="41"/>destruction (<ref target="n80">80</ref>); following this, came a series of questions and replies in the which the martyrdom of Gomez, Burgos and Zamora (<ref target="n81">81</ref>), native priests judged and condemned for their part in the rebellion of Cavite in 1872 was exalted, and they passed on to the proofs (<ref target="n82">82</ref>) which consisted in imitating an assassination, a suicide, etc. This was followed by the taking of an oath of striving to effect the liberation of the people till death, an oath which demanded a blind obedience to the commands of the superior and the preservation of the secrets of the association under the pain of death (<ref target="n83">83</ref>). Finally, to terminate the ceremony, they made with a dagger especially adapted to that use, an incision in the arm of the person initiated and with the blood which flowed from the wound thus made, the new <hi>katipunero</hi> signed his compromise (see note <ref target="n50">50</ref>.)
</p><p>&#171;The initiated were called <hi>brethren</hi> and had their &#171;sacred words&#187; and their special signs of recognition. They were ruled by a code which established punishments ranging from whipping till death (<ref target="n84">84</ref>) and received no orders from anyone, or had no intercourse with anyone, except with their immediate superiors. The details which might be made <pb id="pb42" n="42"/>mention of are infinite and curious, but it would make this short memorial unending to speak of them all.
</p><p>&#8220;All the matters of importance and organization were dealt with in assemblies (<ref target="n85">85</ref>) constituted by the Supreme Councils and all the presidents of the provincial and popular councils. The accords were taken and discussions decided by a nominal <sic>votation</sic> and at least by a majority of votes.
</p><p>&#8220;Both the Supreme, the provincial and the popular Councils and the sections held their periodical sessions in the which were discussed a thousand different affairs, and the decisions of the Councils had to be submitted to the approval of the immediate superior. The gatherings were always held in different houses and localities, no day being set aside as fixed, but the days of festivities or those upon which was observed some ecclesiastical feast were chosen for that purpose (<ref target="n86">86</ref>), under the pretext of banquets or dances in <corr sic="the "/>which the authorities had no suspicion, and because on the said days these semi-public rejoicings were permitted without the necessity of seeking the license of the governing authorities.
</p><p>&#171;Both the provincial and the popular <pb id="pb43" n="43"/>councils and the sections were known by special names; the initiated were &#8220;baptized&#8221; with symbolic <corr sic="apellations">appellations</corr>; and the documents were drawn up in the Tagalog dialect, the most important being in secret code.
</p><p>&#8220;The first Supreme Council was constituted on the 15th of July 1892, and was as follows:

<table id="t2"><row><cell rows="1" cols="1">President            </cell><cell rows="1" cols="1"/><cell rows="1" cols="1">Deodato Arellano.</cell></row><row><cell rows="1" cols="1">Secretary            </cell><cell rows="1" cols="1"/><cell rows="1" cols="1">Andr&#233;s Bonifacio.</cell></row><row><cell rows="1" cols="1">Treasurer            </cell><cell rows="1" cols="1"/><cell rows="1" cols="1">Valentin Diaz.</cell></row><row><cell rend="vertical-align(middle)" rows="3" cols="1">Councillors

</p><p>Delegates were immediately appointed to establish sections in Tondo, Binondo, Trozo, Sta. Cruz, Nagtajan, Sampaloc, Quiapo, Dilao (Paco) and Intramuros. Commissioners set out with all rapidity to the neighboring pueblos and provinces, and in a few weeks councils were in working order in Caloocan, Malabon, Mandaloyan, San Juan del Monte, Pandacan, Sta. Ana, and Pasay. In the Capital of Cavite was constituted a popular council, and sections in Noveleta, Cavite Viejo and Imus. The same occurred in San Isidro, Gapan and several other pueblos of these provinces.
<pb id="pb44" n="44"/></p><p><corr sic="&#8216;">&#8220;</corr>Andr&#233;s Bonifacio, Secretary of the Supreme Council, displayed a notable audacity and energy, and this united to a clear intelligence, gave him a great predominance over his companions. This predominance he asserted, and in 1893 brought about the destitution from the presidency, of Deodato Arellano, Rom&#225;n Baza (<ref target="n87">87</ref>), chief clerk of the Comandancia General de Marina being elevated to that office. On account of the want of character and initiative on the part of the new president, Bonifacio decided, by a <hi lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">coup-d&#8217;&#233;tat</hi> if we may so call it, to depose him also, putting himself in that office and becoming the &#171;dictator&#187; of the Katipunan.
</p><p>&#8220;Under the Presidency of Bonifacio, the society commenced an era of febrile activity; the greater number of the <hi lang="es" xml:lang="es"><corr sic="tribunal s">tribunales</corr></hi> of the pueblos were converted into centres of propaganda, which were directed by the municipalities. Pamphlets and proclamations against the friars and the whole Spanish element were circulated in profusion (<ref target="n88">88</ref>). Injuries and outrages were invented, and by these and a thousand and one other infamous means, little by little, hatred and revenge were inculcated into the mind of the indian.
<pb id="pb45" n="45"/></p><p>&#8220;In 1895 Bonifacio took the first decisive steps towards the organizing of an armed rebellion; he sent different delegations to Dapitan to <corr sic="eonfer">confer</corr> with Rizal and receive his advice and instruction (<ref target="n89">89</ref>)<corr>;</corr> he opened negotiations with the Japanese <corr sic="Goverment">Government</corr> (<ref target="n90">90</ref>), but did not succeed therein. But with his immense <corr sic="ascendency">ascendancy</corr> over the popular masses, an ascendancy beyond imagination, he declared himself dictator. The secret aiders of the Katipunan who pertained to the upper classes, offered funds of considerable amount, with the which were acquired a good number of arms which were landed on the coast of Cavite and Batangas with the aid of wealthy persons (<ref target="n91">91</ref>).
</p><p>&#171;In August of this year (1896) exaltation among the masses reached its full height, and Bonifacio realizing the fact, prepared what was necessary in order that in a short time, the conspiracy which was to take effect on the same day and hour in almost all Luzon, should be in readiness. The plan of the attack and taking of Manila was coarsely conceived but it might have been <corr sic="successfull">successful</corr> and massacre, sacking and pillage would have crowned the iniquitous work.

</p><p>&#8220;But why continue<corr sic=".">?</corr> <corr sic="Itwould">It would</corr> not be exaggerating to assert that the fourth of the native population pertained to the Katipunan, and the task of consigning more names would be useless, as nothing new would be discovered.
</p><p>&#8220;Astounding is the number of the initiated; in Manila and its province alone they <corr sic="exeed">exceed</corr> 14,000, and in the provinces of Cavite, Batangas, Laguna and Nueva Ecija <pb id="pb48" n="48"/>there are no less than <corr sic="20.000">20,000</corr>. Adding to this number those of the remainder of Luzon, the total will ascend to an enormous mass of &#8220;illusioned&#8221; who bowed in obedience to an <sic>inquisitous</sic> schemer. It must be recognized, however, that Bonifacio is not a common man; of active character, energetic and bold, gifted with a facility of expression in his language which suggested itself to his countrymen; of a criterion clear but badly cultivated by the reading of books of an elevated style and a pernicious character<note n="a">Pio Valenzuela y Alejandro, a near companion of Bonifacio in matters relative to the Katipunan, testified in his evidence in the courts of Justice, (fols <corr sic="1.663">1,663</corr> to <corr sic="1.673">1,673</corr>), that Andr&#233;s Bonifacio had read much, and possessed a library which was destroyed when his house caught fire. (See note <ref target="n16">16</ref>) That he would pass the night in reading instead of sleeping, and that from such an excess of reading there had happened to him the same as happened to Don Quixote&#8212;his brain had become turned. Thus it was that Andr&#233;s was ever dreaming of the presidency and speaking of the French Revolution.<corr sic="&#8221;"/></note> and possessed of an unfathomable ambition&#8212;such was the warehouse porter who had charge of the store house of the foreign commercial house of Fressel <pb id="pb49" n="49"/>and Co. in Calle Nueva, Binondo<note n="a">It was in the warehouse of this German firm that the Spanish authorities discovered the documentary evidence which Valenzuela testified had been hidden there by Bonifacio. It had been <corr sic="determided">determined</corr> by the Katipunan to destroy all documents, but evidently Bonifacio overtaken suddenly by the unexpected discovery of the plot he was developing, had not sufficient presence of mind, or what is more probable still, enough time to put them out of existence, and he therefore hid them as has been said, hoping no doubt, to be thus enabled to put the authorities off the track in case they should happen to get possession of them.</note>.
</p><p>&#8220;His proclamations, pamphlets, and circulars although not a model of literature were possessed of a certain amount of culture.
</p><p>&#8220;In Calle Clavel, in the dwelling house of Alejandro Santiago, the Katipunan possessed a secret printing establishment, in <corr sic="the "/>which were prepared many most injurious and insulting publications. There also was edited and published the paper <hi>Kalayaan</hi> (Liberty) (<ref target="n93">93</ref>) which only twice saw the light and which was supposed to have been printed in Yokohama, (it bearing the name of that town as the place of publication) and was published over the signature of Marcelo H. del Pilar. This was <pb id="pb50" n="50"/>all false, all studied out for the purpose of throwing dust in the eyes of the local authorities. The paper was edited by Bonifacio, his brother-in-law Teodoro Plata and the secretary of the Supreme Council, Emilio Jacinto, a young student of law, of no scanty intelligence.
</p><p>&#8220;On the 19th of August last (1896) the conspiracy was denounced and a great number of imprisonments were made by this Corps. Bonifacio and those more closely connected with him in his schemes, fled aghast to the neighboring pueblo of Caloocan and there remained hidden in the house of the <hi>Capitan Municipal</hi> (a native) and in that of the <hi>Capit&#225;n Pasado</hi> (also a native) Adriano de J, father-in-law to Andr&#233;s Bonifacio. On the 23rd Bonifacio set out for the barrio of <corr sic="Balintanac">Balintauac</corr>, followed by some 200 inhabitants of Caloocan; on the 24th they were combatted by the Civil Guard in the fields of the said pueblo and fled to their former hiding place.
</p><p>&#8220;The Supreme Council convoked a large assembly to be held on the following day in the said barrio, to which gathered more than 500 members; there a discussion took place concerning the steps which would <pb id="pb51" n="51"/>have to be taken in view of the failure of the conspiracy, and of the imprisonments which were being made. Some, feeling repentant, desired to return to a legal status, submitting to the Spanish authority but the president Bonifacio protested, proposing immediate rebellion. Both propositions were put to the vote, and as a result, that of the president gained by an immense majority; so much for the prestige of Andr&#233;s Bonifacio! (<ref target="n94">94</ref>).
</p><p>&#8220;The orders were circulated with rapidity throughout Manila, Cavite, Nueva Ecija and other provinces, commanding that armed rebellion should commence at day-break of Sunday the 30th. The day and hour assigned finally arrived, and the whole province of Manila broke out; the rebels committing a thousand and one abuses and crimes upon as many Europeans and loyal natives as were encountered. Like wild beasts they attacked the waterworks and the powder station situated at San Juan del Monte from whence they were <corr sic="valiently">valiantly</corr> driven back by a section of artillery and another of the 70th <corr sic="regimeut">regiment</corr>. Simultaneously they attempted to invade the suburb of Sampaloc by way of Santa Mesa and <pb id="pb52" n="52"/>there also they were combatted and dispersed by 60 Veteran Guards who prevented, by their defence, a day of mourning for the city of Manila. All Cavite, except the capital, arose in insurrection on the afternoon of the 31st., assassinating and disarming the whole of the Civil Guard of the province, after an heroic defence on the part of the latter. They assaulted the convents and estates of the Religious Orders and murdered the defenseless ministers of the Lord (<ref target="n95">95</ref>). On the 3rd of September the capital of Nueva Ecija was attacked by large masses of rebels, and the colony<note n="a">That is to say the Spanish population.</note> and the Civil Guard <corr sic="heroicly">heroically</corr> resisted until the arrival, from Manila, of a column which combatted the enemy and saved that handful of Spaniards from a certain death.

A name which all Spaniards should pronounce with pleasure, because, by his repentance, inspired by divine Providence (<ref target="n96">96</ref>), Spain was saved from an unending series of bitter experiences.
</p><p>&#8220;Pati&#241;o, a workman in the printing establishment of the <hi lang="es" xml:lang="es">Diario de Manila</hi>, pertained to the Katipunan of Tondo, as did also the majority of the compositors and book binders of the said establishment.
</p><p>&#8220;Repentant and fearful of the increase of the association, and of the criminal projects it pursued, he decided to denounce it to his sister, a student of the College of Looban, directed by the learned and virtuous Sisters of Mercy (<ref target="n97">97</ref>). His sister made known the <corr sic="denounciation">denunciation</corr> to her Superior who called Pati&#241;o into her presence; and realizing the gravity which surrounded the matter, sent him to the Rev. P. Mariano Gil, parish priest of Tondo (<ref target="n98">98</ref>), a suburb of Manila; to this Rev. Father, <pb id="pb54" n="54"/>Pati&#241;o repeated all that he had manifested, and all that he could know, he being only a simple initiated member. He affirmed that in the printing establishment of the <hi lang="es" xml:lang="es">Diario</hi> receipts and proclamations were printed, and daggers were secretly made for the Katipunan, and he offered, moreover, to make known where the lithographic stones used for the printing were hidden.
</p><p>&#8220;Srs. Grund and Cort&#233;s, lieutenants of the sub-division of the <hi>Veterana</hi> of that district, were called to the convent by P. Gil, who expounded to them all that had occurred. These officers made known the facts to their chiefs, and constituted themselves into a &#8220;cuartelillo&#8221;. That same night there fell into the power of P. Gil the lithographic stones, some receipts and printed regulations of the Katipunan: objects which were placed at the disposition of this Corps. In the &#8220;cuartelillo&#8221; Pati&#241;o was minutely examined, and immediate proceedings were commenced for the arrest of 22 oath bound katipuneros, whose houses were also searched. In this search an abundance of documents and effects which justified the denunciation were encountered. From that time no stone was left unturned <pb id="pb55" n="55"/>by the officers and guards of this Corps, who for 15 days worked unceasingly and untiringly that their labor might be crowned with the greatest success.

</p><p id="n2"><hi rend="sc">Note 2.</hi> In that period of time in which the evil effects of freemasonry began to tell upon the public and private life of the government officials and upon the morals of the people in general, the Civil Governor of Manila, D. Justo Martin Lunas (1886), gave a ball to which the cream of Manila society was invited. Among the selections for the evening was an extravagant item, nothing more or less than ... a <hi>can-can</hi>! This in itself was enough; but what made the matter so much the worse was that the governor had invited the venerable Archbishop of Manila to the ball. The news of the innovation spread far and wide, and very soon the whole city was in a state of wild excitement. In the defense of public morals the Archbishop deemed it necessary to issue a pastoral letter condemning such spectacles.
</p><p>Although not directed at that particular &#8220;school of scandal&#8221;, this pastoral was interpreted by all those concerned, as well as by the public in general, as a severe <pb id="pb60" n="60"/>lesson for Sr. Lunas and those who had gathered in the government house to dance the can-can or to take pleasure therein. Hence Sr. Luna and his party considered themselves<corr sic=","/> offended, and did not hesitate to take <corr sic="vevenge">revenge</corr> when an opportunity occurred, upon the aged and infirm Archbishop who did all he had done, in defense of the morals of his flock.
</p><p>From this event sprung the seed which gave rise, later on, to the famous, or rather <hi>infamous</hi> manifestation of &#8217;88: an insensate campaign inspired against the Religious Orders by these offended ones and their followers (See note <ref target="n30">30</ref>).
</p><p>The Civil Governor at that time was D. Jos&#233; Centeno y Garc&#237;a an active propagator of freemasonry, holding the 33rd degree. He, together with Sr. Quiroja, fostered and godfathered the &#8220;manifestation&#8221;. In this semi-official insult to Archbishop Payo, an insult so ably analysed by Sr. Retana<note lang="es" xml:lang="es" n="I">Avisos y profecias, Madrid 1892. pp. 286&#8211;308<corr>.</corr></note>, we have one of the best examples that could be furnished of the methods adopted by the masonic enemies of the Catholic <pb id="pb61" n="61"/>faith in this archipelago. This manifestation, fostered by a governor who drew down upon himself the righteous ire of all honorable men and women by reason of his protection of the houses of ill-fame in and about the city, was a truly masonic invention by which many, in fact some 98% of those who signed it, were grossly deceived. The following notes taken from the analysis of Sr. Retana, will give an idea of the real value of the &#8220;manifestation&#8221; and the part the <hi>people</hi> had therein. In the Suburb of Sta. Cruz there were 144 people who signed the document, that is to say there were 144 names. Of these no less than 56 were <hi>unknown</hi><corr>,</corr> 3 were minors and 3 did not recognize their signatures; 52 were natives and 8 were <corr sic="chinese">Chinese</corr> half-castes. In Sampaloc: 61 signatures, all of which were of indians none of whom followed trades or professions which necessitated the use of brain power. In Malate: 38 signatures<corr>,</corr> 31 of indians<corr>,</corr> only 15 of whom understood Spanish. In Binondo: 41, 31 of whom were indians; five minors. In Sta. Ana, out of 104, the <corr sic="mumber">number</corr> of minors was 14, and 50 did not understand Spanish; 66 were indians. In Caloocan: <pb id="pb62" n="62"/>80 signatures of which 55 were indians who did not understand Spanish; 38 were laborers, 7 were minors. In Navotas: 140 signatures; 49 laborers, and 49 fishermen; 127 did not understand Spanish. In Mariquina: 68, 38 of whom were laborers, 51 did not understand Spanish. In San Fernando de Dilao (Paco): 35; 6 minors and all indians. In San Mateo, 50 signatures<corr sic=":">;</corr> 39 laborers<corr sic=".">,</corr> 45 indians, 41 of whom did not understand Spanish. In San Miguel 49; and here comes the crowning piece of the magnificent work, for of these 49 no fewer than 16 had <hi>died!</hi> yes <hi>died</hi> previous to the drawing up of the document and therefore could not possibly have signed it; moreover 7 did not recognize their signatures, and all were indians.
</p><p>In recapitulation; there were 810 signatures; of these 85 did not declare on examination, 56 were unknown, 39 were minors, 22 did not recognize their signatures and 16 had died previous to the drawing up of the document (Feb. 20th 1888). This brings the 810 down to 592. Of these 592 signatures 208 were of laborers, 50 of fishermen, 31 of carpenters, 7 washermen and 5 barbers: a total of 301 persons whose <pb id="pb63" n="63"/>occupations called for no particular amount of education, and whose interest and concern in such a movement as this may be judged from their social standing. Deducting these 301 from the remaining 592 we have 291 left for further analysis. Of these 25 were of tailors, 4 singers (!) and 3 school masters; 58 <hi lang="es" xml:lang="es">escribientes</hi> whose occupation it is to make clean copies of documents and other manuscript, the most that can be said of the majority of them being that they can write well, not an uncommon thing anyhow for a filipino; 11 of musicians, men who lead the life of crickets, enjoying hunger by day and noise by night; 9 type-setters, men who after having set a dozen columns of material could not tell you anything of the subject they were composing, in other words, men who like the <hi lang="es" xml:lang="es">escribientes</hi> reproduce mechanically without knowing what they are reproducing; this gives us 107 of another grade leaving 184 to be divided among the many odds and ends of occupations followed by the native to earn his &#8220;fish and rice&#8221;. No less than 384 of the number did not understand Spanish and 13 could not write. In the matter of races: ONE was a Spaniard, Enrique Rodriguez <pb id="pb64" n="64"/>de los Palacios who called himself a merchant and was domiciled in Binondo. Upon investigation it turned out that he also had been fooled and that he had signed the protest because he had been told that other Spaniards had also signed it; as to its contents he affirmed that he knew nothing. One was a Spanish mestizo, 66 were Chinese half-castes and 524 were indians. So much for the famous manifestation which resulted in giving a most decisive blow to the moral and social standing of those who prepared and those who signed it. Those concerned therein learned the bitter lesson that <corr sic="&#8221;">&#8220;</corr>they who dig pits for their neighbors are apt to fall therein themselves.&#8221;
</p><p>The common opinion has always been that the document in question was drawn up by Doroteo Cort&#233;s (see note 11) who had on several occasions been under police vigilance; had been expelled from Navotas and compelled to reside within the walled city, later on pardoned, but still kept under police surveillance. But however that may be, the document was infamous in the extreme, and was the precursor of the modern campaign against the <pb id="pb65" n="65"/>Religious Orders. From that time to this present, this campaign has continued to spread, and <corr sic="in">is</corr> still being fostered by the Federal Party.
</p><p>Another of the advanced ideas which saw the light of day during the interim governorship of D. Jos&#233; Centeno y Garcia, a 33rd degree freemason and a stout republican, was the toleration, for the first time in the history of the Archipelago, of houses of prostitution. Centeno was a governor who, having erred considerably during his governorship, attempted some years later to regain public confidence by the publication of an insulting pamphlet against the Religious Orders. This novelty of semi-official houses of ill-fame was, for Manila, a most genuine expression of modern democracy. Scandals until then unheard of or undreamed of in Manila, became the order of the day. White girls imported or <corr sic="enveigled">inveigled</corr>, were hired out by their mistresses to pander to the sensual appetites of blacks, merely because the said black-skinned sensualists were wealthy enough to pay the price demanded. What edification! Fundicion street became a centre in which the scandals daily increased in number and importance. <pb id="pb66" n="66"/>The native weaned after many long years of careful training at the hands of the Religious Orders, from the vices in which he was found submerged at the time of the Spanish Conquest, was brought face to face with the same scandalous surroundings, introduced by people of the same white race which had removed his forefathers therefrom. Gradually but surely this leaven of corruption has eaten its way into the customs of the people, and to-day we are witnesses of its terrible effects. A comparison of the public morals of to-day <corr sic="a "/>with those of 20 years or so ago, would reveal facts which would astound many of those who are at a loss to account for the reason of the existence of the &#8220;<foreign lang="es" xml:lang="es">querida</foreign>&#8221; evil among so many of the <corr sic="filipinos">Filipinos</corr> of modern Manila. A quarter of a century ago Manila was a paradise to what it is to-day, crimes so common in these days that they are scarcely worth recording, were unheard of; and even <corr sic="drunkeness">drunkenness</corr> was almost entirely confined to foreign sailors. What Manila is to-day it owes to the advanced and anti religious ideas introduced by freemasonry and modern democracy.


<pb id="pb67" n="67"/></p><p id="n3"><hi rend="sc">Note 3.</hi> Separatism, <corr sic="vulgarilly">vulgarly</corr> called filibusterism, has always, in the Philippines, been marked by <corr sic="essencial">essential</corr> characteristics. It was always, under the circumstances by which it was surrounded, necessarily anti-patriotic. One thing which helped to give it the robust life it enjoyed among the middle class of people, was the supposition of the existence of a <corr sic="tagalog">Tagalog</corr> civilization anterior to the discovery of the archipelago by the famous Magallanes. This fantastic doctrine was preached and propagated principally by two of the more prominent <corr sic="filipinos">Filipinos</corr>, Pedro Paterno and Jos&#233; Rizal. The former, much less cultured than Rizal, was the one to whom the most insensate ideas on this subject were owing, and this because although Rizal upheld the idea, he was led to do so by his perverse character rather than by his belief; whilst Paterno really believes in this pre-Spanish civilization<corr sic=".">,</corr> and that to such a degree that many of his own country-men call him a fool and ridicule him. Another essential mark was the enmity <corr sic="demostrated">demonstrated</corr> against the Religious Orders. But few, if any at all of the propagators of the doctrines of separatism labored outside of the <pb id="pb68" n="68"/>four walls of the masonic lodge room. In other words they were freemasons. Masonry was to them a medium through which they might carry on their conspiracies; it was an excuse for the creation of the spirit of association, till then unknown in the Philippines.
</p><p>The aims of separatism may be <corr sic="clased">classed</corr> as direct <corr sic="and and">and</corr> indirect. The indirect aim was the independence of the country from the yoke of Spain. At the best this idea of independence was but second hand, a lesson learned by heart by a scholar whose power of thought was insufficient to enable him to grasp the true meaning of the words of the lesson. The <corr sic="avarage">average</corr> <corr sic="filipino">Filipino</corr> lacks the sentiment of nationality; hence in the minds of the majority of the people independence is but the enjoyment of the unbridled <corr sic="liberity">liberty</corr> to do as they please, in fact to revert to the times of their ancestors when everyone who could exert an authority was a king, a prince or a ruler of some description. To the <corr sic="filipino">Filipino</corr> it is of little importance whether his <corr sic="soverign">sovereign</corr> or his supreme ruler be the King of Spain or the President of the U. S. of America, as long as he is protected from his &#8220;friends&#8221; and from his own country-men and may enjoy <pb id="pb69" n="69"/>his cock-fighting and have the necessary supply of rice and fish for his daily sustenance.
</p><p>The direct aims of the separatists were those they <corr sic="saught">sought</corr> in public, viz: representation in the Spanish Cortes, the expulsion of the Religious Orders, etc., etc. The result of representation in the Cortes would have been a veritable comedy; that of the expulsion of the Friars a decided <corr sic="tradgedy">tragedy</corr> for Spain, in as much as the Religious was ever the backbone of the administration of the colony. The consequences of the independence of the country would have been equally <corr sic="disasterous">disastrous</corr>. There would have been the tremendous preponderance of the black over the white and eventually <corr sic="intertribual">inter-tribal</corr> disputes and even armed struggles for the mastery. This would entail the complete stagnation of the moral and material progress of the people, who would gradually but surely drift back into the savage ways of their ancestors. And at last, who knows but that Japan or perhaps China would have to step in to save the inhabitants from becoming cannibals.
</p><p>This doctrine of separatism was the doctrine <corr sic="deseminated">disseminated</corr> by <corr sic="filipino">Filipino</corr> masonry, a daughter of Spanish freemasonry. Filipino <pb id="pb70" n="70"/>freemasonry however, was to a great extent addicted to views not held or sustained by the Gr&#8756; Or&#8756; Espa&#241;ol, and hence did not make common cause with Universal Freemasonry, although it used its ritual, its signs and its name, to shield from public view those of its labors which could not be allowed to see the light of day. Hence the diving into the subject of Universal Freemasonry is somewhat <corr sic="irrevelant">irrelevant</corr> to our present study, suffice it to say that the brotherhood, universal as it is, suffers no other division than that into families. Its aim is one; its methods one; its doctrine one<note n="a"><p>Concerning the doctrines of Universal Freemasonry D. Gabriel Jogand-Pag&#233;s says <corr sic="wiriting">writing</corr> on the subject of freemasonry in Spain: &#8220;The teaching which according to the ritual of the 33rd degree is the <corr sic="syntesis">synthesis</corr> of freemasonry, is well worthy of being borne in mind.&#8221;
</p><p>&#8220;In the reception to the 33rd degree, the Grand Master turning to the person to be received, ends his discourse with the following significant exhortation:
</p><p>&#8220;I owe you, Illustrious brother, an explanation which it is <corr sic="necesary">necessary</corr> to give to our rituals.&#8221;
</p><p>&#8220;Masonry being nothing else than active revolution, permanent conspiracy against political and religious despotism,....&#8221;

</p><p>&#8220;The Grand Master innocent, you have already seen, is man ... man who was born innocent because he was born unconsciously.&#8221;
</p><p>&#8220;Our Grand Master Innocent was born to be <pb/>happy and to enjoy in all their fullness all his rights without exception: But he fell, struck with the blows of three assassins: of three infamous beings who placed formidable obstacles in the way of his happiness, and against his rights....&#8221;
</p><p>&#8220;These three infamous assassins are: the Law, Property and Religion&#8221;.
</p><p>&#8220;The Law because it is not in harmony with the rights of the individual man and the duties of the man who lives in society: rights which all acquire in all their integrity....&#8221;
</p><p>&#8220;Property: because the earth is the property of no one and its products pertain to all in the measure for each one of the true necessities for his welfare.&#8221;
</p><p>&#8220;Religion: because religions are no more than the philosophies of men of talent, which the people have adopted....&#8221;
</p><p>&#8220;Neither the Law, Property nor Religion can impose themselves upon man, and as they deprive him of his most precious rights they are assassins against whom we have sworn to exercise <corr sic="they">the</corr> utmost <corr sic="vengance">vengeance</corr>.
</p><p>&#8220;Of these three infamous enemies, Religion ought to be the object of our constant mortal attacks, because a people never have survived their religion, and <corr sic="detroying">destroying</corr> religion we have at our disposition the law and property and we can then regenerate society, establishing over the ruins, masonic Religion, masonic Law and masonic property.&#8221;</p></note>; <pb id="pb71" n="71"/>it is the worldly imitation of the <corr sic="unparalled">unparalleled</corr> Catholic unity of divine foundation.
</p><p>The Spanish family was founded in 1811 <pb id="pb72" n="72"/>by the Count de Grasse-Tilley. On the 21st of February 1804 the Supreme Council of Charleston issued a circular to the Count in which it said among other things which demonstrate the aim of the foundation: &#8220;Above the idea of country is the idea of humanity&#8221;; &#8220;frontiers are capricious <corr sic="demarkations">demarcations</corr> imposed by the use of force.&#8221; And others of the same nature.
</p><p>When the Count set forth to found the Spanish Supreme Council he was armed with a letters patent issued by the Supreme Council of Charleston containing this sentence: &#8220;the masonic solidity will never be effective whilst the brethren do not recognize one only power, as is one only the earth we inhabit<corr sic=".">,</corr> and one also the horizon we contemplate.... To unify, therefore, the masonic labors we all journey to the one end to which the work of this Supreme Council is directed, and hence what we have pointed out to Spain as one of the points in which is more <corr sic="neces sary">necessary</corr> than elsewhere the one direction to which we refer.&#8221;
</p><p>In 1882 Spanish freemasons were divided into different Orientes each of which claimed continuity with the institution of Grasse-Tilley; <pb id="pb73" n="73"/>the matter was finally settled by the Supreme Council of Charleston.
</p><p>Opinion is divided on the question of the <corr sic="responsability">responsibility</corr> of the Spanish freemason lodges or rather the ruling &#8220;Oriente&#8221; for the beliefs and practices of their filipino brethren. That they were indirectly responsible is more than certain; and oft-times they were so indirectly. D. Manuel Sastr&#243;n ex-Deputy to the Spanish Cortes, ex-Civil Governor of the Philippines, speaking on this subject says: &#8220;It is not possible for us on any account to fall in line with these suspicious reasonings: never have we had a disposition to form a part of such a sect, because we are old time Christians; but we repeat that we cannot believe nor do we imagine that any masonic centre composed of peninsular Spaniards could tolerate, and much less <corr sic="forment">foment</corr> consciously, the propagation of doctrines which, whatever masonry brought about in the <corr sic="Philipines">Philippines</corr>, could have given origin to the congregation of separatist elements.&#8221;
</p><p>&#8220;Nevertheless side by side with this firm conviction we repeat what we <corr sic="tercely">tersely</corr> <corr sic="ma-maintained">maintained</corr>, viz: that freemasonry has been the medium which marshalled the element <pb id="pb74" n="74"/>which generalled the <corr sic="filipino">Filipino</corr> insurrection. Filibusterism knew how to exploit it to a fine point.&#8221;
<milestone rend="dots" unit="tb"/>
</p><p>&#8220;We do not find it inconvenient to affirm, but just the opposite, we repeat with pleasure and absolute belief that Spanish freemasonry was ignorant of the true ends of the <corr sic="filipino">Filipino</corr> masons. But it is proved to our way of thinking, to the point of evidence, that <corr sic="filipino">Filipino</corr> masonry <corr sic="persued">pursued</corr> no other ends than the independence of those islands (the Philippines.)&#8221;<note n="a"><corr>&#8220;</corr><foreign lang="es" xml:lang="es">Insurreccion en Filipinas</foreign>&#8221;; vol. I. p. 109.</note>
</p><p>It must be noted that this is the opinion of a Spanish patriot, for a patriot Sastr&#243;n certainly was, and what is more natural than that a true patriot should doubt the possibility of his own countrymen mixing themselves up in anti-patriotic movements: Yet while Sastr&#243;n and other writers would redeem their fellow countrymen from such a stain as that of treason, I am inclined to believe that the asserted ignorance of the Spanish freemason was too often <hi>official</hi>, that is to say it was not genuine, <pb id="pb75" n="75"/>but limited to the members of the society who enjoyed the privileges of the lower degrees.
</p><p>There are two sides to every question<corr sic=";">,</corr> however, and that the &#8220;other side&#8221; may be given a fair hearing, I will quote a declaration of Antonio Luna on this subject. Luna, among the many statements made before the Lieut<corr sic=",">.</corr> Col. in command of the Cuartel de Caballeria, on the 8th of October 1896, confessed that &#8220;in the year 1890 or 91, of his own <corr sic="free-wiil">free-will</corr>, he formed a masonic project based on Spanish masonry: a project which might, at its proper time be applied to filibuster conspiracy. This project was discussed and approved by the Oriente Espa&#241;ol in Madrid; but that center did not know the <corr sic="secondry">secondary</corr> ends to which it would be applied.... Of his own <corr sic="freewill">free-will</corr> he manifested that his ideas were, when he formed the project, anti-Spanish....&#8221;
</p><p>With rare exceptions the <corr sic="filipinos">Filipinos</corr> who left their native soil to finish their education in the Spanish <corr sic="peninsular">peninsula</corr>, were those to whom the real work of separatism is owing. The <corr sic="filipino">Filipino</corr> at home who has fallen into line with his foreign educated <pb id="pb76" n="76"/>brother is but a blind worker. And the <corr sic="filipino">Filipino</corr> who went to Spain was as a rule, a very general rule, taken under the sheltering care of Miguel Morayta (see note <ref target="n13">13</ref>). The responsibility therefore for the ideas inculcated into the minds of those &#8220;students&#8221; lies, and that heavily, upon Morayta, the chief of that family of freemasonry which claims ignorance of the aims of its filipino membership. The only logical excuse that can be brought forwards is that filipino freemasonry degenerated. When once it took root in the Archipelago it spread with wonderful rapidity. The adepts were for the most part <corr sic="chinese">Chinese</corr> half-castes; and little by little that strange train of thought of the native, whether he be full blooded or mixed, a train of thought which, like the filipino pony is accustomed to walk backwards when it should go forwards, or like the patient <hi>carabao</hi> which too often lies down just at the moment when its services are the most needed to drag a load over a mud hole, carried the <corr sic="would be">would-be</corr> citizens of an <corr sic="independant">independent</corr> country to the verge of political insanity. Certain it is that as the idea of separation became more and more developed the Spanish masons who were member <pb id="pb77" n="77"/>of the <corr sic="filipino">Filipino</corr> lodges severed their connection therewith. But yet it does not appear within the limits of common sense to believe that the Spanish masons were ignorant; the greater probability is that they were too indulgent, too confiding. To hold too fast to the excuse of ignorance is to profess oneself very ignorant. But whether it was ignorance or the wanting of even that species of <corr sic="patriotsm">patriotism</corr> which one expects to find in beasts of burden (for every horse knows his own stables) the black fact still remains that Spanish masonry gave birth to, and fostered, <corr sic="filipino">Filipino</corr> freemasonry or in other words, the katipunan.
</p><p>However, be the degree of ignorance what it may, we cannot overlook the fact that the actions of the <corr sic="tagalog">Tagalog</corr> freemasons, the katipunan if you will, for the one and the other are the same thing under different names, were the cause of no little surprise to the Grand Oriente Espa&#241;ol. The filipino mason was a traitor to the mother which gave him being and nourished him into activity: a traitor who used the cover of the freemason lodge only that he might the easier and safer hatch out his plot to gain, by the most brutal means imaginable, <pb id="pb78" n="78"/>the <corr sic="independance">independence</corr> of his country.
</p><p>In his declaration made in the presence of Colonel Francisco Olive y Garcia and others on the 23rd of September 1896, Moises Salvador Francisco, of Quiapo (Manila) stated that &#8220;in April 1891 he came to Manila bringing with him a copy of the agreements arrived at by the Junta of Madrid, and these he handed over to Timoteo Paez to see if masonic lodges could be established as a commencement of the work. In the following year of 1892 Pedro Serrano arrived from Spain and then Masonry (native) was introduced into the Philippines, the first lodge instituted being the <hi>Nilad</hi>.&#8221;
</p><p>To give some idea of the separatist aims which gave life and <corr sic="nourishmeut">nourishment</corr> to the <corr sic="tagalog">Tagalog</corr> revolt, I will quote a few extracts taken from masonic documents, and from the declarations, made by persons complicated in the conspiracy. These declarations were made in the presence of the appointed judge, Col. D. Francisco Olive y Garcia, and others, and are of capital interest in the study of the rise and fall of the filipino &#8220;commune&#8221;.

<pb id="pb79" n="79"/></p><p>I. In an act of Session of the <hi>Katipunan Sur</hi> at the commencement of the year 1896, the session being opened, the president don Agustin Tantoko, a native priest<note n="a"><p>One not acquainted with the seducing nature of the masonic operation and the peculiarity of the native character, would wonder to find the name of a Catholic priest so intimately connected with freemasonry and its offspring, especially in a country in which the Church wages close and continual warfare with the evil. There is little need for surprise however, when we consider the seductive influence of the one hand and the simplicity and childishness of the native character on the other. Many of the native clergy were body and soul wrapt up in the workings of freemasonry and were Spain&#8217;s worst and most crafty enemies.
</p><p>In Nueva Caceres, Inocencio Herrera, Severo Estrada and Severino Diaz, three native priests of the <corr sic="Catedral">Cathedral</corr> of that diocese, headed the conspiracy against the <corr sic="Goverment">Government</corr>. They formed a deposit of arms and <corr sic="amunition">ammunition</corr> in the organ of the Cathedral and, according to the plan they had prepared, one of their <corr sic="firrt">first</corr> steps was to murder the Bishop of the diocese. On this point it will be interesting to quote the testimony of Tom&#225;s Prieto, of Nueva Caceres, who, whilst on board the S. S. Isarog, on the 20th of September 1896, testified in the presence of the captain of the Ship and other witnesses that he had received 50 rifles, 10 of which he had given into the care of <corr sic="Mannel">Manuel</corr> Abella, a millionaire of that province who was eventually executed <pb/>for treason; the remainder he had distributed among other persons, 3 being <corr sic="place">placed</corr> in the care of Severino Diaz, parish priest of the Cathedral of Nueva Caceres....<corr sic="&#8221;"/> As to their plans of action, he testified that the intention was to kill all the <corr sic="Spainards">Spaniards</corr>, the mentioned parish priest of the Cathedral, the coadjutor Inocencio and Severo <corr sic="Entrada">Estrada</corr>, all natives, having promised to aid personally to <corr sic="seeure">secure</corr> the success of the affair.
</p><p>He also declared that &#8220;on the 9th of July of the same year, a reunion was celebrated in the house of Manuel Abella, and among those present were Gabriel Prieto, a native priest and brother of the witness, Severino Diaz and others; it was <corr sic="ln">in</corr> this reunion that it was decided to carry out the programme above mentioned.&#8221;
</p><p>In both provinces <corr sic="oc">of</corr> the Camarines many were mixed up in some of the dirtiest work of the revolt.
</p><p>Innumerable cases might be mentioned also in which the native <corr sic="clargy">clergy</corr> have exerted considerable influence against the American Government, inciting the rebels to resist its lawful authority, much to the detriment of the interests of the Church and <corr sic="bringuing">bringing</corr> down upon the clergy in general accusations of sedition and treachery. Juan Casta&#241;eda testified that he had been initiated into the mysteries of freemasonry by Severo Buenaventura, a native priest, coadjutor of Imus. Buenaventura received his initiation from Ambrosio Flores, now the Governor of the province of Rizal; he possessed three grades and enjoyed the use of the symbolic name of &#8220;cuitib&#8221; (the <corr sic="mame">name</corr> of a small ant which bites furiously).

Mariano Kalisan considered, dealing with the first question, that &#8220;<hi>as their principal object was not to leave alive any Spaniard in all the future <corr sic="filipino">Filipino</corr> republic</hi>&#8221; they should procure to make friends with them as much as possible in order to be able to carry out their plans with more surety when the time should arrive to give the cry of independence. D. Gabino Tantoko, brother of the president, considered that the said principle should be carried out especially in dealing with the members of the Religious Orders. Both propositions were accepted.
</p><p>As regards the second question, Epifanio Ramos proposed that meetings should be held as seldom as possible &#8220;<hi>in order to avoid scandals</hi>&#8221;.
</p><p>In case of surprise, Hermenegildo Garc&#237;a considered that &#8220;<hi>the strongest fort lay in denial</hi>.&#8221; The brothers Tantoko remarked that such surprise was almost impossible seeing that they had determined &#8220;<hi>not to leave alive any of those who might surprise them</hi>.&#8221; The president moreover remarked that, from that time forward, in case of <pb id="pb82" n="82"/>danger, &#8220;they should destroy all the papers they held in their power, such as acts, receipts, letters, plans and especially the arms they held, in case the blow they were to deal in Manila should not succeed.&#8221; This was accepted unanimously.
</p><p>In reply to a question, the president affirmed that &#8220;all the sections of Katipunan existing in the future <corr sic="filipino">Filipino</corr> republic <corr sic="persued">pursued</corr> the same end: viz: the independence of the <corr sic="filipino">Filipino</corr> people<corr>,</corr> the release from the yoke of the step-mother<note n="a">The word in the original Spanish is <hi lang="es" xml:lang="es">madrasta</hi> which, apart from that of step-mother, has the meaning of &#8220;anything disagreeable.&#8221;</note> Spain.&#8221;

</p><p>&#8220;6th. On the following day the bbro&#8756; designated shall bury all the bodies of their hateful oppressors in the field of Bagumbayan together with their wives and children, and on the site shall later on be raised a monument commemorative of the independence of the G&#8756; N&#8756; F&#8756; (<foreign lang="es" xml:lang="es">Gran Naci&#243;n Filipina</foreign>).&#8221;
</p><p>&#8220;7th.

</p><p>III. In his declaration made before Col. Olive y Garc&#237;a, the second Lieutenant D. Benedicto Nijaga y Polonis, a native <pb id="pb84" n="84"/>of Carbeyeng, province of Samar, stated that the conspiracy was entered into for the purpose of securing from Spain, by peaceful means, or by the process of revolution, the independence of the country. He affirmed moreover that, in the case of revolution, the aid of Japan was to be <corr sic="saught">sought</corr> and that the <corr sic="co operation">co-operation</corr> of the native troops was expected: and that the plan of <corr sic="compaign">campaign</corr> of the rebels who were in San Mateo, was to &#8220;fall upon Manila&#8221;, the native infantry sent out to meet the attack to pass over to the rebel ranks.
</p><p>IV. In his declaration made in Manila before the same judge, Pio Valenzuela y Alejandrino stated that he was one of the members of the <corr sic="Inferior">Interior</corr> Supreme Council of the Katipunan, the aim of which was to collect a large amount of money and promote a general rising in order to declare the independence of the islands under the protectorate of the Empire of Japan<corr sic="&#8221;"/>. Further on he stated that the rising was to have taken place at 7 o&#8217;clock p. m. on the 29th of August, entry being made into Manila and its suburbs, the rebels &#8220;killing the Spaniards, and the natives and <corr sic="chinese">Chinese</corr> who did not wish to follow them, and then <hi>devoting <pb id="pb85" n="85"/>themselves to the sacking of the town, to robbery and incendiarism and the violation of women</hi>.&#8221;
</p><p>V. Romualdo de J., sculptor of <corr sic="ta.">Sta.</corr> Cruz, Manila, declared that he had founded the Katipunan in 1888, the year in which the manifestation against the Archbishop was made; he defined the aim of the society to be &#8220;<hi>the killing of all the Spaniards</hi> and the taking possession of the islands.&#8221;
</p><p>VI. In his declaration made in Cavite<corr sic=".">,</corr> September 3<corr>,</corr> 1896, Alfonso Ocampo affirmed that according to the plans formulated, they were &#8220;to make the assault, killing and robbing all the peninsular <corr sic="spaniards">Spaniards</corr>.&#8221; And moreover, that &#8220;the rebellion had for its object <hi>the assassination of all the peninsular Spaniards, the violation and beheading afterwards of their wives and of their children even to the youngest</hi>.&#8221;
</p><p>Many others might be cited; with these six samples an idea may be gathered of the progressive idea advocated or fostered by Rizal, Pilar, Lopez, Ponce, the Lunas, Rosario, Cort&#233;s, and others who were inspired by Morayta, the Grand Master of the Gran Oriente Espa&#241;ol.


<pb id="pb86" n="86"/></p><p id="n4"><hi rend="sc">Note 4.</hi> The then Civil Governor of Manila, in a report to the Colonial Minister concerning what was taking place in Manila says, speaking of this Corps:
</p><p>&#8220;... this Corps of Vigilance which, although composed of no more than 45 persons including the inspectors of the same ... renders a service (to the Government in secret service work) which should be confided to 100 persons, considering the nature and the amount of the work undertaken and <corr sic="perfomed">performed</corr> daily, from the day of the formation of the Corps to this day: a period of about a year. The interesting body of police which under my orders has performed such valuable services, is that which has attained greatest success in the fruitful labor of making clear the <corr sic="vandalic">vandalistic</corr> events we have been experiencing.&#8221;


</p><p id="n5"><hi rend="sc">Note 5.</hi> <hi>Filibusters</hi>: more properly called separatists. Noah Webster describes a filibuster as a &#8220;lawless military adventurer, especially one in quest of plunder; a free-booter, a pirate.&#8221; Hence, taken in its true meaning, the word does not apply to the separatists of the Philippines. Retana classifies the filibuster in three groups: the first: he <pb id="pb87" n="87"/>who, thinking little or nothing of the independence of his country, showed more or less aversion to the peninsular Spaniards. 2. He who, under the pretext or without it, of illustrating his countrymen, inculcated into their minds political ideas which, without meriting the qualification of subversive, tended to incite <corr sic="then">them</corr> against supposed oppressions of the Spaniards; against all things which appeared behind the times, hence according to their way of arguing, against the Religious Corporations, to which they owed everything except their anti-Spaniardism. As a rule those belonging to this group professed great love for the mother-country and did not preach ideas of independence; they held the belief that theirs was the duty to prepare the way for the emancipation which should be attained by their grandchildren. And 3. Those whose aim was to attain the emancipation of their country as soon as possible. This latter group were the true separatists. It is however difficult to distinguish between the filibuster so called, and the true separatist; perhaps the only <corr sic="admisible">admissible</corr> distinction is that the separatist is a man of peaceful methods whilst the <pb id="pb88" n="88"/>filibuster is a man of struggles. Rizal was more or less a separatist, Andr&#233;s Bonifacio a veritable filibuster.


</p><p id="n6"><hi rend="sc">Note 6.</hi> Sr. Olive was a gentleman who well deserved the respect and honor paid to him by his nation, and the hatred of those whose plans of treachery he thwarted and who, in spiteful revenge, have gone so far as to accuse him of using torture and other forcible means of <corr sic="exorting">extorting</corr> confessions, many of which they claim to have been false. Sr. Olive was too kind-hearted a man to stoop to such methods even had the circumstances demanded the use of moderate <corr sic="physicial">physical</corr> persuasion.
</p><p>At one time Sr. Olive was the Governor of the Marianas Islands concerning the which he wrote and published a very interesting memoir. He was at that time Lieut. Colonel.
</p><p>Later on he was made Colonel and as such was placed at the head of one of the sections of the Guardia Civil of Manila. He was secretary of the sub-inspection of arms of the Philippines. When a state of war was declared, the charges which were at that time being prepared in connection <pb id="pb89" n="89"/>with the insurrection, were handed over to Sr. Olive, who with a zeal worthy of praise, and an energy too seldom exerted, commenced to deal out strict justice to the enemies of their country. About a year and a half ago Sr. Olive was made General of Brigade.


</p><p id="n7"><hi rend="sc">Note 7.</hi> According to a pamphlet written by a <corr sic="pseudonomous">pseudonymous</corr> freemason and printed in Paris in 1896, the first lodge founded in the Philippines was that established in Cavite about 1860 under the name of <hi lang="es" xml:lang="es">Luz Filipina</hi> and subject to the Gr&#8756; Or&#8756; Lusitian, enjoying immediate correspondence with the Portuguese lodges of Macao and <corr sic="Hong-kong">Hong-Kong</corr> which served as intermediaries between that lodge and those of other neighboring countries.
</p><p>Another statement however, from the pen of Sr. Nicolas Diaz y P&#233;rez who formed his data from the original documents of the lodges, places the first foundation at the end of the year 1834. At this time, says Sr. Diaz, D. Mariano Marti, who died twenty-seven years later, whilst on his return to Spain, founded, together with others, lodges in various parts of the Archipelago, but they did not prosper and soon dissolved. <pb id="pb90" n="90"/>The epoch of intrigues which produced so much disquietude and perversion of moral customs and ideas, more especially in the Tagal provinces, commenced about 1868. The masonic activity at that time was owing greatly to the political intriguers who were deported from Spain to this archipelago, where their influence was felt in no small degree, to the detriment of public morals.
</p><p>About 1872, during the interim government of Gen. Blanco Valderrama, a lodge was founded in Sampaloc, subject to the Gr&#8756; Or&#8756; Esp&#8756;, and composed entirely of peninsular Spaniards with the exclusion of natives.
</p><p>In the same year D. Rufino Pascual Torrej&#243;n reached Manila and united his efforts to those of Marti, founding lodges purely Spanish.
</p><p>On the first of March 1874 was created the lodge &#8220;Luz de Oriente&#8221; under the obedience of the Gr&#8756; Or&#8756; de Esp&#8756;, the Gr&#8756; Comend&#8756; being D. Juan de la Somera. This was really the first successful establishment of masonry in the Philippines<corr sic=",">.</corr> The cited Sr. Diaz y P&#233;rez says on this point; &#8220;It may be said that freemasonry regularly constituted in the Philippines, dates from <pb id="pb91" n="91"/>the 1st. of March 1874, with the creation of the lodge <hi lang="es" xml:lang="es">Luz de Oriente</hi>....&#8221;
</p><p>On the 1st of March 1875 was installed the Gr&#8756; L&#8756; Departmental, D. Rufino Pascual Torrejon being the Gr&#8756; President.
</p><p>Up to the year 1884 the lodges of the Philippines did not admit to their <corr sic="memberhip">membership</corr> either indians or half-castes; but since that time, and upon the initiative of the Gr&#8756; Mast&#8756; of the Gr&#8756; Or&#8756; Esp&#8756; the doors of the lodges were opened to all indians and half-castes who could read or write. Later on purely native lodges were founded and from that time Spain lost, little by little but surely, her hold upon the people, with the result that she eventually lost her colony. What masonry has accomplished in other parts of the world it also accomplished here very effectually. It laid the foundation for the undermining of society, bringing forth a generation of traitors and building up a kingdom for anti-Christ.
</p><p>As has been proved over and over again by the many masonic documents which have been discovered, freemasonry was ever anti-Catholic in the Philippines; but it was not until it had degenerated into filibusterism <pb id="pb92" n="92"/>that the anti-Spanish spirit really took shape. Year by year <corr sic="thisspirit">this spirit</corr> spread and more, especially among the natives and half-castes of less intellectual capacity. Among this element, separatist ideas spread with marvelous rapidity owing to the peculiarity of the character of the native and of the half-caste, more especially the <corr sic="chinese">Chinese</corr> half-caste. (See note <ref target="n19">19</ref>).
</p><p>Up to 1890, even <corr sic="filipino">Filipino</corr> masonry enjoyed but insignificant development. By 1892, however, it had spread widely, and in the following year Manila was gifted with a female lodge founded on the 18th of July of that year, under the name of &#8220;La Semilla&#8221;, of which Rosario Villareal, the daughter of Faustino <corr sic="Villaruel">Villareal</corr>, was declared the Ven&#8756; Gr&#8756; Mistress.
</p><p>From this time the element of politico-social decomposition gained ground among the native and half-caste population. New ideas continually gave place to the old and as the aims and purposes of the lodges degenerated, these centers of anti-catholic propaganda became more and more anti-Spanish.
</p><p>Isabelo de los Reyes, in an attempted defense of his &#8220;friends&#8221;, makes the important <pb id="pb93" n="93"/>confession that &#8220;Filipino freemasonry was not so inoffensive as it was believed.... The &#8220;Liga&#8221; at least was a school of conspiracy, and in truth, the <corr sic="filipinos">Filipinos</corr> did not turn out bad pupils.&#8221;
</p><p>Another demonstration of the inoffensiveness of freemasonry is the following series of facts taken from a pamphlet published in 1896 in Paris by Antonio Regidor under the pseudonym of Francisco Engracio Vergara. Regidor was a distinguished figure in the attempted revolt of 1872, and hence may justly be supposed to know something of the matter of which he speaks. He says:
</p><p>&#8220;By reason of the rising of Cavite many <corr sic="filipinos">Filipinos</corr> characterized as progressives were deported to <corr sic="Marinas">Marianas</corr>.... To the masons of Hong-Kong was owing the flight of several <corr sic="filipinos">Filipinos</corr>....&#8221;
</p><p>&#8220;The foreign masons distributed arms in Negros, Mindanao and Jolo. The official bank of Singapore distributed in Cebu, Leyte and Bohol over &#163;<corr sic="80.000">80,000</corr> stg., and that of <corr sic="Hong-kong">Hong-Kong</corr> more than &#163;<corr sic="200.000">200,000</corr> in Panay and Negros.... The French freemasons at the petition of <hi>brother</hi> Paraiso, went to aid also the escape of the deported in Marianas.&#8221;


<pb id="pb94" n="94"/></p><p id="n8"><hi rend="sc">Note 8<corr sic=",">.</corr></hi> <hi>Rizal</hi> and others: Of this group Rizal, Pilar, the Lunas and Cort&#233;s, formed the more guilty part, they being men of superior education and more enlightened minds. Rizal was the center upon which almost everything connected with the revolt turned. During his younger days he lived with his parents in Calamba, where they occupied a stretch of land owned by the Dominican Corporation. The Rizal family was one of those most favored by the Dominicans<note n="a">A contract was made between the administrator of the estate in question, situated at Calamba, and Francisco Mercado Rizal<corr>,</corr> father of the subject of this note, for the land the Rizal family occupied and cultivated. This land measured some 500 <corr sic="hectareas">hectares</corr> and was clear and clean, the tenant having merely to give it three or four turns with the plow in order to prepare it for use. To show the treatment meted out to the tenant, it will be sufficient to say that the contract agreed that the tenant should have <hi>the entire use of the land and its product for four harvests or five years</hi> RENT FREE. As great as this advantage was to the Rizal family it is but a little of what was done by the Dominicans for that <corr sic="ungratiful">ungrateful</corr> family of filibusters.</note>, and one of those ungrateful ones too, which commenced law-suit against the said Corporation to unjustly possess themselves of the land they held at rent.
</p><p>Rizal received his <corr sic="secondry">secondary</corr> education at <pb id="pb95" n="95"/>the Ateneo Municipal conducted by the Jesuit Fathers, and was always a bright attentive and successful pupil. At that time he was secretary of the Sodality of the Blessed Virgin and Promoter of the Apostleship of Prayer. Whilst he remained true to the traditions of Catholic Spain, he was an upright pious youth. Much of his time he spent in carving wooden images of the Blessed Virgin and of the Sacred Heart, and in writing compositions, some of them remarkable for their beauty, in which were reflected a pure love for Spain.
</p><p>Having attained the degree of Bachelor he left the Ateneo and passed to the University of Manila, continuing his studies under the Dominican Fathers. There he studied medicine with great success for some years, and at length went to Europe to terminate his career and take his degrees.
</p><p>Rizal left school like so many other filipino students, overloaded with science he was unable to direct, full of pride because of his accomplishments, and very ambitious. He terminated his studies in Madrid and Germany, in both of which places he fell in with a class of people who utilized him as a tool to accomplish an end at that time <pb id="pb96" n="96"/>unknown to him. They filled his head with new and false ideas, making him vain promises which appealed to his pride, and by their dark arts made of him a <hi>separatist</hi>. He also studied English and German, his studies in this latter language making him enthusiastic in the things of Germany and, in an extraordinary degree, with those of protestantism.
</p><p>Among his own people he was the possessor of an exceptional intelligence and talent but outside his own circle his most famous accomplishments are but poor to the student of Literature. His sadly famous <hi lang="es" xml:lang="es">Noli me tangere</hi> and <hi lang="es" xml:lang="es">El Filibusterismo</hi> cannot pass for more than very second-hand for their ingenuity and literary taste, but they possess the quality of being a mirror in which is reflected the inclinations, character and perverse moral sense of their author. In them he is reflected as a restless spirit anxious for human glory, haughty and above all, anti-Spanish and ungrateful in the extreme.
</p><p>It was in Berlin that he published his <hi>Noli</hi> in 1886. That this novel was written by Rizal there in no doubt, but that the ideas therein expressed came directly from <pb id="pb97" n="97"/>his own head is more than doubtful. Like the vast majority of <corr sic="filipino">Filipino</corr> productions, it is but a copy taken from models which had struck the fancy of the author. The pictures he draws therein of the disadvantages suffered by the <corr sic="filipinos">Filipinos</corr> who have become espa&#241;olized, are but reproductions prepared in his own coarse and crude way of thinking, of the most scurrilous anti-Spanish and anti-Catholic works of propaganda produced by the Bible Societies and spread abroad throughout the world as gospel truth. Taking away the insults hurled against the Church and the Religious Orders, and against Spain, there is absolutely nothing new in the novel. Its object was to attack the friars and the chiefs of the Guardia Civil, both of which the author well knew to be the sustainment and guarantee of peace and order in the Archipelago and consequently the strongest support of the Spanish <corr sic="soverignty">sovereignty</corr> in the Philippines, a sovereignty he wished to overthrow. To a reader whose library consists of a half a dozen books of insignificant literary value, the <hi>noli</hi> of Rizal is a masterpiece; but to the reader who has seen a book with a cover, who has had some experience <pb id="pb98" n="98"/>of that portion of the world which lies outside the limits of the town of his birth, and who is gifted with more or less ability to think for himself, and sift the wheat from the straw in a literary composition, <hi>noli me tangere</hi> is but a half-tone picture cut from a newspaper and colored with water-colors by a ... school-boy.
</p><p>Towards the end of 1887, Rizal returned to the Archipelago, remaining about two months, during the which he made active propaganda of the ideas and fancies he had picked up in Europe: ideas which he himself could not really understand.
</p><p>In February 1888 he left Manila for Japan, from whence he returned to Europe, living for a while in Paris and later on in London.
</p><p>In 1892 Rizal, relying upon the generous character of D. Eulogio Despujols, the then Governor General of the Archipelago, decided to return to Manila. From <corr sic="Hong-kong">Hong-Kong</corr> where he was then residing, he wrote to the governor, asking permission to return to his home; the Governor replied by means of the Spanish Consul at <corr sic="Hong-kong">Hong-Kong</corr>, that he had no reason to prohibit him from returning, and that he could do so when it so pleased him, providing he came with <pb id="pb99" n="99"/>no intention to disturb the peace then reigning in the Islands.
</p><p>This Rizal lost no time in doing; he arrived together with his sister. The baggage of both was carefully examined and in one of the trunks was discovered a bundle of leaflets in the form of anti-friar proclamations which indicated the bad faith of a traitor. These were handed over to Despujols unknown to Rizal. The Governor preserved them in his desk for future reference. In an interview with the Governor, Rizal begged pardon for his father who was under sentence of deportation for certain events which had taken place in Calamba; this was granted him without reserve.
</p><p>Our hero soon forgot the aims he professed to the Governor; instead of thinking about his folks and making his arrangements for the colonizing scheme he professed to have worked out in Borneo, he set to work to stir up disrespect towards the authorities, and the spirit of political unrest. He together with Doroteo Cort&#233;s and Jos&#233; Basa were the objects of careful vigilance on the part of the secret police.
</p><p>After a few days a <corr sic="prolongued">prolonged</corr> conference took place between the Governor General <pb id="pb100" n="100"/>and Rizal. During this conference the latter made patent his political feelings, at the same time making protestations of respect for Spain. His political programme however was not in keeping with his protestations of patriotism, and this fact so angered Despujols, who now saw that Rizal&#8217;s idea was to fool him, that he took from his <corr sic="draw">drawer</corr> the proclamations discovered in the agitator&#8217;s baggage and thrusting them <corr sic="ander">under</corr> the nose of the traitor, said:
</p><p>&#8212;And these proclamations; what are they, what do they mean?
</p><p>Rizal taken by surprise and confounded, cowardly declared that they were the property of his sister, a declaration which only enraged the General the more, and he ordered his detention in Fort Santiago; on the following day he decreed his deportation to Dapitan.
</p><p>Whilst in exile his opinion and advice were <corr sic="saught">sought</corr> concerning the advisability of immediate armed rebellion. But he, crafty, more or less far seeing and, above all, jealous of Bonifacio&#8217;s increasing ascendancy over the people, refused to countenance the idea. Granting the unselfish desire he professed of seeking merely the independence <pb id="pb101" n="101"/>of his country, Rizal&#8217;s <corr sic="jealously">jealousy</corr> was justified. Bonifacio&#8217;s one great idea was the <hi>presidency</hi>; Rizal&#8217;s: the honor and glory of having prepared the way for, and eventually, by his labors accomplishing his country&#8217;s deliverance from what he was pleased to call the <corr sic="oppresion">oppression</corr> of the Spanish Government. Had such <corr sic="oppresion">oppression</corr> existed, Rizal&#8217;s idea would have been worthy of classifying <corr sic="as as">as</corr> noble. George Washington well deserved the name of the &#8220;Father of his Country,&#8221; for he, laying aside all selfish aims and desires, led a handful of men against a <corr sic="hoarde">horde</corr> of mercenaries sent by a cruel monarch who <corr sic="oppresed">oppressed</corr> his people, not only in <corr sic="thc">the</corr> colonies but in the mother-country also. Washington was a man who deserved and received the respect of those against whom he fought, for he fought for a principle. Such an honor never has, and never can be received by Rizal from his own countrymen. The campaign Rizal fought was inspired by and worked out in the freemason lodges which used our &#8220;hero&#8221; as a willing tool. Rizal was a <corr sic="filipino">Filipino</corr> Garibaldi, never a <corr sic="filipino">Filipino</corr> Washington, and hence the honors paid to his memory as a &#8220;patriot&#8221; must <corr sic="eminate">emanate</corr> from the lodge rooms which made <pb id="pb102" n="102"/>him what he was, and not from the people of his country.
</p><p>In Dapitan the <corr sic="filipino">Filipino</corr> agitator was not inactive. On one <corr sic="occassion">occasion</corr> he directed a letter (which never reached its destination on account of its having fallen into the hands of Spanish authorities) to the Capitan Municipal of the province of Batangas, giving him information of the work of filibusterism which was at that time being carried on.
</p><p>Rizal, tiring of his position in Dapitan, eventually asked permission of the Governor General, Gen. Blanco, to be sent to Cuba as physician to the Spanish forces there. Blanco agreed to the proposition and ordered his return to Manila in preparation for the voyage to Spain, where he was to be sent and placed at the disposition of the Minister of War.
</p><p>From Spain came word, however, that the petition could not be accepted; and for a very good reason. Rizal&#8217;s idea of becoming an army surgeon, was a manifest pretence, his real aim was to aid the separatist movement there, if he ever got there, but <corr sic="primarly">primarily</corr> to make his escape at an intermediate port, Singapore probably<corr sic=".">,</corr> if opportunity occurred. Moreover, it having come <pb id="pb103" n="103"/>to the ears of the authorities that certain people of Pampanga <corr sic="aud">and</corr> Bulacan were preparing a reception for the agitator, the Governor ordered that he should not be allowed to leave Dapitan, and that should he have left there, he should not be allowed to land in Manila on his arrival, but be <corr sic="transfered">transferred</corr> to another ship which should carry him back to Mindanao. It happened that he had left Dapitan on board the S. S. Espa&#241;a, and in due time he arrived at Manila. At 11 a. m. on the 6th of August the ship on which he came anchored in the bay and everyone landed except Rizal. A lieutenant of the Veterana went aboard and took possession of the person of Rizal, holding him as a prisoner till <corr sic="7. 30">7:30</corr> p. m., at which time, through an error in the delivery of an order, he was allowed to disembark. This he did in company with his sister Narcisa, and they made their way to the office of the Captain of the Port and later on to the Comandancia of the Veterana. His sister not having been under sentence of <corr sic="deporation">deportation</corr>, was allowed to go to the home of her relatives.
</p><p>During the evening of the same day Gen. Blanco gave a reception at Malaca&#241;ang at which were present the Archbishop <pb id="pb104" n="104"/>of Manila, the Illust. Sr. Bernardino Nozaleda; Sr. Echaluce; Sr. Fernandez Victorio, President of Audiencia; <corr sic="Sr:">Sr.</corr> Bores Romero, the Civil Director and others. During the reception Gen. Blanco received a telegram from the Governor of the province of Batangas stating that in the pueblo of Taal, in the house of the brother of the <hi>filibuster</hi> Felipe Agoncillo, had been discovered a quantity of arms and ammunition, among other things being 10 revolvers, 10 <corr sic="winchester">winchesters</corr>, 10 other guns, a case of explosive bullets, a quantity of dynamite, a Japanese flag, another composed of red and blue with a representation of the sun in the center surrounded by seven stars&#8212;the flag of the <hi>future</hi> <corr sic="filipino">Filipino</corr> republic. Blanco realizing the importance of the news, formed a committee from among those present, <corr sic="chosing">choosing</corr> those who were members of the Junta of Authorities, to take steps in the matter. Orders were immediately given that Rizal should be placed on board the cruiser Castilla which was stationed at Cavite; this was carried out, the start from Manila being made at 11 p. m. the same night. This action was considered necessary, in as much as the news of the landing of <pb id="pb105" n="105"/>Rizal spread fast and caused no little stir among his followers.
</p><p>Whilst Rizal was on board the cruiser Castilla which was awaiting orders, the Katipunan revolt broke out in Manila and the suburbs. Very soon afterwards his voyage Spainwards was commenced on board the S. S. Colon, the insurrection becoming more and more wide-spread daily. On finding to what an extent Rizal was complicated in the work of the revolution, his return to the Archipelago, as a prisoner, was demanded, and so our &#8220;hero&#8221; returned to be judged as were so many of his fellow agitators, for the crimes for which he was morally and physically responsible.
</p><p>A council of war was constituted under the <corr sic="precidency">presidency</corr> of Lieut. Col. Tabares, Capt. Tavil de Andrade taking charge of the defense of the prisoner. The accusation preferred against him was that he was the chief organizer of the revolution. The trial took place in the hall of the Cuartel de Espa&#241;a in the presence of a large audience among whom were his sister and the woman with whom he had been living in Dapitan. The charge having been read out, several declarations were made by Rizal, <pb id="pb106" n="106"/>some before his voyage to Spain and others since his return were also read. During his trial Rizal denied the knowledge of several persons who were his intimate friends and co-workers; among them Maximo Inocencio and Mariano Linjap, and others with whom he had been in almost continual communication. He denied knowledge of the &#8220;Liga Filipina&#8221; stating that not only did he not found it, but that he was not aware of its existence. He affirmed ignorance of who Valenzuela was, and almost immediately afterwards stated that he had held an interview with him in Dapitan when that individual had been sent there by Bonifacio to consult him on the subject of armed rebellion. Throughout the whole trial he <corr sic="persued">pursued</corr> the same tactics, proving that, of himself, he was but an ordinary <corr sic="filipino">Filipino</corr> indian who, when left to himself to stand on his own merits, gave no signs of particular judgement or power of thought. The <corr sic="filipino">Filipino</corr> on trial, even for some significant affair, cannot tell a lie to advantage: Rizal was no exception even in this. The trial being ended he was condemned to execution.
</p><p>Previous to meeting his death he confessed and received the Holy Communion from <pb id="pb107" n="107"/>the hands of the Jesuit Fathers having after long consideration, made the following retraction of his errors:


    <q rend="block"><p>&#8220;I declare myself Catholic and in this religion in which I was born and educated I wish to live and die. I retract with all my heart all my words, writings and actions that have been contrary to my condition as a son of the Catholic Church. I believe and profess whatever She teaches and I submit to whatever She demands. I abominate masonry as an enemy of the Church and as a society condemned by the Church.

    </p><p>&#8220;The diocesan prelate, as superior ecclesiastical authority, may make public this spontaneous manifestation, to make reparation for the scandals which may have been caused by my works, and that God and my fellow-men may pardon me.&#8221;

    </p><p>&#8220;Manila 29th December 1896.&#8212;Jos&#233; Rizal.&#8212;Witnesses: Juan del Fresno, Chief of Picket.&#8212;Eloy Maure, Adjutant.&#8221;</p></q>

</p><p>He also entered the holy bonds of matrimony with the young woman with whom he had been living for some time in Mindanao. On the way to the place of his <pb id="pb108" n="108"/>execution he remarked to one of the Fathers who accompanied him. <hi>Father, it is my pride that has brought me here.</hi>&#8221;
</p><p>Of the political error committed by the Spanish Authorities in the execution of Rizal, I do not hold myself up as a judge. All governments, like human beings, commit mistakes and at times grave ones. The Spanish authorities, feeling themselves justified in so doing, ordered the execution of the <corr sic="prissoner">prisoner</corr> who was responsible for one of the most bloody revolts since the time of the French revolution: the pattern taken by the <corr sic="filipino">Filipino</corr> leaders, for the means of the foundation of the <corr sic="filipino">Filipino</corr> republic. Rizal was executed on the Luneta. To assert that he was offered up as a victim to gratify the wishes of the Religious Orders is but a crude and vicious argument worthy of its inventors and propagators. Nothing, absolutely nothing, can be brought forward to prove such an assertion, but on the contrary, those members of the Religious Orders who concerned themselves in the stirring affairs of the revolution were, as a very general rule, opposed to harsh and extreme measures being taken; and among these was the Illustrious Archbishop of Manila, <pb id="pb109" n="109"/>Sr. Nozaleda, a noble, tenderhearted and compassionate prelate<corr sic=".">,</corr> a prelate who has been dubbed by Foreman as &#8220;<hi>the blood-thirsty Archbishop</hi>&#8221;<corr>.</corr> Had the friars held the reins of government as they are stated to have done, history would not have to record the names of so many, many people who <corr sic="where">were</corr> executed: people who were scarcely to be held as guilty, in as much as they were but sheep who <corr sic="thoughtlessy">thoughtlessly</corr> followed their shepherds without even looking to see where the road they trod would lead them.
</p><p>In politics Rizal had his party composed of a number of insignificant petty-lawyers, petty-doctors and others possessing academic titles and a semi-formed cerebral power. These were backed by a mass of the people of Calamba, Rizal&#8217;s birthplace. In their eyes he was a &#8220;Messiah&#8221;<corr>,</corr> a &#8220;Mahdi&#8221;, their prophet and redeemer. As an individual he was bright and intelligent, and had he not been led astray by those who made a &#8220;cat&#8217;s paw&#8221; of him, and who cruelly deserted him in his hour of need, he would doubtless have been one of the foremost <corr sic="filipinos">Filipinos</corr> of to-day in that sphere of life in which God had placed him.
</p><p>A Spanish proverb says: <corr>&#8220;</corr>In blind man&#8217;s land the one eyed man is a king.&#8221; Rizal was a <hi>king</hi>.


<pb id="pb110" n="110"/></p><p id="n9"><hi rend="sc">Note 9.</hi> Marcelo Hilario del Pilar y Gatmaytan was a native of Bulacan. He was, by profession, a lawyer, and had been enabled to complete his studies in that direction through the good offices of the Augustinian Fathers of Manila, who had given him the money necessary to matriculate and to pay the cost of his title of &#8220;<foreign lang="es" xml:lang="es">abogado</foreign>.&#8221;<note n="(a)">Lawyer.</note>
</p><p>Pilar left Manila for the <corr sic="peninsular">peninsula</corr> about the end of &#8217;88 for fear of deportation: a punishment at that time staring him in the face. He was one of the earliest workers on the &#8220;La Solidaridad&#8221;, the official organ of <corr sic="filipino">Filipino</corr> freemasonry in all its sections. He later on became its director.
</p><p>Pilar was another of the many malays whose ways were beyond human comprehension. Spaniards who have lived a life-time among the indians and studied them carefully from all points of view agree that the deeper one studies the native character the more incomprehensible it becomes. That is, the study of the average filipino: Pilar was one of the average. He was not gifted with the education enjoyed by Rizal, nor was he such a stupid visionary as Pedro Paterno; he possessed touches of the character of both.
<pb id="pb111" n="111"/></p><p>Like so many of those <corr sic="filipinos">Filipinos</corr> who fed at the hands of the Religious Orders, he eventually turned to bite the hand that fed him. As in the case of the others who had done the like, he did so, not because he had cause to, but because he fell, as did they, under the evil influence of those who utilized them to work out their schemes of treachery.
</p><p>Pilar was sent to Spain as a delegate of the Committee of propaganda. Owing to this position of chief of the delegation in Madrid, and by reason of his intimate friendship with Morayta, he occupied a position from which neither Rizal nor even the whole of the <hi>progressive</hi> indians combined, could drive him. He held, for some time, high office in the Gr&#8756; Or&#8756; Esp&#8756; as will be seen from the following clipping taken from page 107 of the Annual of that Orient for the year 1894&#8211;95.

</p><p>It was Pilar who conceived the plan of <pb id="pb112" n="112"/>the Katipunan; and yet after all it was not his conception, for the scheme he formed was at the best, a piece of patch work made up of the plans worked out in the various revolutions which had taken place in some part of the world.
</p><p>What Pilar&#8217;s ambition was, it is hard to say; from his actions and writings one is almost driven to the supposition that he had none in particular, but was led to the separatist labors he performed by force of compromise.
</p><p>When the time was ripe for action Pilar determined to leave Madrid and make his way to Japan. He commenced the journey arriving at Barcelona, from whence he was to make his way east. There, however, he was taken suddenly ill, and died on the 4th of June 1896, in the Hospital of that city.
</p><p>In many things Pilar was superior to Rizal. Unlike that agitator, Pilar was not a sneaking, skulking petty-politician; he was straight-forward and had the courage of his opinions. What Pilar would have done if placed in the same circumstances as Rizal it is hard to say, but we may be assured that he would not have acted the coward as did Rizal.

<pb id="pb114" n="114"/></p><p>&#8220;The military knowledge of Sr. Luna, acquired during his captivity (sic) in the prisons of the <corr sic="peninsular">peninsula</corr> (Spain), is to be found condensed in two small works, one concerning the organization of the army, having as its base the idea of obligatory service in which he <corr sic="demostrates">demonstrates</corr> that Luzon might put on a war footing <corr sic="250.000">250,000</corr> to <corr sic="400.000">400,000</corr> men, and the whole archipelago as many as from <corr sic="800.000">800,000</corr> to <corr sic="900.000">900,000</corr>.

The first number was published on Saturday, 3rd Sept<corr>.</corr> 1898. Its leading article is an exposition of the purpose of the publication of the paper, which was the defense of the independence of the Philippines. &#8220;We defend, says the writer of the article, the independence of the <corr sic="Philipines">Philippines</corr> because it is the aspiration of the country which has come of age; and when a people rise as a man to protest, arm in hand, against a policy of oppression and injustice, it manifests sufficient vitality to live free.&#8221; This is a fair sample of the style of the conduct of the paper. It is worthy of <pb/>note that the history of the revolt has clearly shown that, in the first place, independence was not the aspiration of the <hi>people</hi>, but a fanciful hope of a handful of exploiters; secondly that the country has not come of age, not having even reached the age of <corr sic="pubety">puberty</corr>; thirdly that the <hi>people</hi> did not rise as a man but that the Tagal &#8220;discontents&#8221; were the body and soul of the whole insurrection both against Spain and against the U. S.; and finally, that the &#8220;policy of oppression and injustice&#8221; was imaginary, the same complaint having since been made against the Government of Washington as was then made against the Government of Madrid. The quotation concerning Luna is taken from No. 2 of the paper published on the 5th of Sept. 1898.</note>
</p><p>Juan, from childhood, was of an artistic <pb id="pb115" n="115"/>turn of mind and found among his many protectors those who sent him to Spain to study art. In Spain he met with Sr. Alejo Vera, a noteworthy artist, under whom he studied, receiving an exceptional education both in art and in morals, Sr. Vera being a <corr sic="christian">Christian</corr> gentleman. Later on he went to Rome, and there formed part of the Spanish artistic colony. After some two or three years of study there he sent to Spain his first painting<note n="(a)">The principal works of Juan Luna are: <hi>The death of Cleopatra</hi> for which he received a silver medal; this was painted under the tutorship of Sr. Vera. Under the same master he painted the <hi>Spoliarium</hi> for which he was rewarded a gold medal, <pb/>but this not really for the merit of the picture but in order to put an end to a rivalry between two Spanish painters. On his own account he painted and gave forth <hi>The Battle <corr sic="af">of</corr> Lepanto</hi>; this was received almost with hisses and was heartily criticized. Also the <hi>Profanation of the Tombs</hi>; if anything this was worse. As the savage nature which lay dormant in his breast became more and more awakened his paintings became more and more decadescent: his <foreign lang="es" xml:lang="es">Pacto-de-Sangre</foreign>, in the which he inspired the return to one of the most barbarous customs of pre-Spanish times in the archipelago, rubs off the last touches of the veneer of civilization which formed the dividing line between the indian of the city and the indian of the mountain and forest.</note>. Being an artistic production of a <corr sic="filipino">Filipino</corr> indian it was received <pb id="pb116" n="116"/>with open hands and given a reception greater than it really deserved, as a result of the influence of Luna&#8217;s friends. From Rome he went to Paris. It was in that city that he committed the fiendish double murder which so startled and shocked his friends and acquaintances, his victims being his wife and his mother-in-law, sister and mother of a prominent political aspirant of modern Manila. The result of the trial was that the courts of Justice of Paris absolved him. He then returned to Madrid, and soon after, to Manila.
</p><p>What Spain did for the Filipino brought <pb id="pb117" n="117"/>forth fruit in only a few of the people who fell under her beneficent christian influence. The Lunas were among the few. They, like so many other ungrateful children, repaid their benefactors by becoming leaders of the insensate and inexcusable revolt against them: a revolt, the first act of which was to be the brutal murder of all Spaniards irrespective of parentage or other claims of consideration. Both the brothers suffered arrest by the Spanish authorities for rebellion <corr sic="aud">and</corr> sedition, but in spite of the degree to which they were complicated, they remained practically free from punishment, and ever at the right hand of the imbecile General Blanco, himself a freemason, and friend of the enemies of his country. Eventually the two brothers left the <corr sic="anti-chamber">ante-chamber</corr> of the Governor to enter the security of the military prison.
</p><p>Both brothers eventually retracted their errors only to fall into them again as soon as the lying protests of repentance had fallen from their lips.
</p><p>Juan died in Hong-Kong; Antonio, after a career of militarism <corr sic="secumbed">succumbed</corr> to the same unprincipled ambition which carried Andr&#233;s Bonifacio to an untimely grave.

I will therefore complete the coincidence by saying all I have to say of this person in thirteen lines.
</p><p>Morayta was at one time Gr&#8756; Master of the Gr&#8756; Or&#8756; de Espa&#241;a, but was later on expelled therefrom<corr sic=".">,</corr> according to a masonic publication.

<pb id="pb123" n="123"/></p><p id="n14"><hi rend="sc">Note 14.</hi> <hi>Tagalog</hi>: The Tagalogs are a branch of the Malay family which, in former times, dominated from Madagascar to the ends of the Pacific. They form part of what we might call the Malay-Chinee race, i. e. the cross between the female on the Malay side and the Chinee on the side of the male. This cross has been taking place from time immemorial, commencing long before the islands were discovered by the Spanish explorers. The present Tagalog indian enjoys more of the characteristics of the Chinee than of the Malay on account of the potency of the <corr sic="chinee">Chinee</corr> blood over the <corr sic="malay">Malay</corr>.
</p><p>Going back to ancient times the probability is that the original Malay first became modified by its crossing with the inhabitants proper of the archipelago&#8212;the <corr sic="negritos">Negritos</corr>&#8212;marks of which mixture are still <corr sic="descernable">discernible</corr> in <corr sic="may">many</corr> of the Tagalogs.
</p><p>A second modification came through the mixture between the Malay-Negrito and the Indonesian, traces of which are seen in the light color of the skin in a portion, although small, of the Tagalogs. Another modification, the most marked, originated from the crossing of the Malay-Negrito-Indonesian <pb id="pb124" n="124"/>with the Chinee, the <corr sic="chinee">Chinee</corr> being marked by the increase in stature, the elevation of the skull and other minor marks.
</p><p>During the last three centuries this hybrid Tagalog has undergone another small and gradual change by reason of a limited crossing with Spanish blood. This latter mixture however is insignificant in extent but always produces a superior type. As a people the Tagalogs number about one and a half millions, and inhabit the regions around about Manila. The traits of character of the four principal trunks from which the <corr sic="tagalog">Tagalog</corr> of to-day is derived are, although still present in a greater or lesser degree, considerably modified by climatological and historical circumstances.
</p><p>At the coming of the Spaniards the Tagalogs, like the remaining native peoples of the archipelago, were met with in the depths of the savage ages, and were to a certain extent, of cannibalistic tendencies.
</p><p>The <corr sic="avarage">average</corr> Tagalog is not wanting in courage, a fact he has often displayed, but this courage is never seen to advantage except when the indian is under the leadership of a person of exceptional valor or a strict disciplinarian. Like most peoples <pb id="pb125" n="125"/>derived from the Malay stock, the Tagalog indian is subject to strange fits of mental aberration, the fits taking different forms, generally innocent ones, the worst being a homicide under the <corr sic="influencie">influence</corr> of a &#8220;hot head&#8221;. At least that is what might have been said of him 8 or 10 years ago, previous to the time in which he became fanaticised by freemasonry<corr sic=",">.</corr> He is not even yet apt to run <hi>amok</hi> as is usual among the Malays and this is undoubtedly due to the civilizing religious influence which has been brought to bear upon him during the three centuries of Spanish rule in the Archipelago. It is a noteworthy fact that in the same degree as the influence of religion, of the Religious Orders if you will, became <corr sic="lessed">lesser</corr>, in exactly equal degree did crime increase. Explain this as you will the fact remains that during the four years or so that the indian has been under the care and protection of a government indifferent to all religion, crime has increased a hundred fold, perhaps arithmetically so also, and crimes unheard of in days gone by, have become so common as scarcely to merit mention in the columns <corr sic="af">of</corr> Manila&#8217;s yellow journalism. What the Tagalog <pb id="pb126" n="126"/>indian is equal to when free from the restraint of the Catholic religion, has been seen from the fearful crimes and barbarities committed against Spaniards and against Americans during the insurrection. The brutalities <corr sic="commited">committed</corr> upon the unfortunate prisoners who fell into their hands were unheard of even among the savage <corr sic="arab">Arab</corr> <corr sic="hoardes">hordes</corr> of the Soudan, nor have the records of the ferocity of the <corr sic="chinese">Chinese</corr> <hi>boxers</hi> yet told us of things equal to the fearful events which took place in the province of Cavite and elsewhere. And for all this the Tagalog indian is responsible: the Tagalog for whom Pedro Paterno claims a pre-Spanish civilization on the plan of the Aztec and ancient Peruvian indians. Like all oriental peoples the Tagalog is superstitious and loves demonstration, symbolism and things grotesque. About the only thing left to him of his ancient <hi>civilization</hi> as Paterno calls it, <corr sic="barberism">barbarism</corr> we generally say, is his mythology. In it everything is more or less connected with spirits. Their faith in what they call their <hi>anting anting</hi><note n="a">For a description of anting-anting see appendix <ref target="appd">D</ref>.</note> is unbreakable. Rizal was supposed to <pb id="pb127" n="127"/>be under the protection of the <hi>anting-anting</hi> but the leaden <corr sic="missles">missiles</corr> which took away his life carried away the <hi>anting-anting</hi> also: and yet there are thousands upon thousands of indians, some of them men of enlightenment, who still cling to the belief that Rizal still lives, thanks to the influence of his protecting amulet. Nor did <hi>anting anting</hi> avail Aguinaldo who now probably believes far more in the protection of his American prison than in that offered by his <hi>anting anting</hi> charms.
</p><p>Their mythology has, like their ancient character, been greatly modified in the vast majority, by the influence of the civilization implanted by Spain. This is one point in which Spain has differed from most nations in methods of civilization and colonization. However we may judge her in respect to her colonial administration in the Philippines, we cannot deny that she has been distinguished from other nations by her aim of preserving the native races of the archipelago, the destruction consequent upon the radical change undergone in everything, being limited to the savage customs and immoralities in which the native peoples were found submerged.
<pb id="pb128" n="128"/></p><p>The masonic lodges spoken of in the text which were asked of Morayta, were <corr sic="estabished">established</corr>, although they were not exclusively Tagalog in their membership. As a result of the petition of the <corr sic="filipino">Filipino</corr> colony mentioned in the same text, the theories and practices of Masonry were carried to the Tagalogs but instead of the needy brethren being aided by the wealthy ones, they were subjected to a contribution in <corr sic="exhange">exchange</corr> for which they received a gaudy regalia; in other words they were bought over with strings of beads and with tinsel truck as were the indians discovered by Capt. Cook in the South Sea Islands, with the exception that Capt. Cook and those who followed him carried civilization to the natives, whilst the founders of the Katipunan carried to the Tagalogs and the other indians of the archipelago misery and demoralization.


</p><p id="n15"><hi rend="sc">Note 15</hi>. <hi>Faustino Villaruel Gomara</hi> was a Spanish half-caste, a native of Pandaran, living in Binondo. He was the founder of the lodge &#8220;La Patria&#8221; of which he was also the Ven&#8756; Gr&#8756; Master with grade 18. He also founded a lodge of female freemasons, for the foundation of which he <pb id="pb129" n="129"/>committed the nefarious crime of prostituting his daughter, handing her over, in the period of her innocence and <corr sic="candour">candor</corr>, to the ridiculous workings and practices of freemasonry. Rosario Villaruel (Minerva), thus sacrificed by her father, was initiated in Hong-Kong and made venerable of the first lodge of female masons in Manila, drawing in after her a large number of her half-caste friends, young folk of bare instruction. This lodge was known as &#8220;La Semilla&#8221;. Its composition was: Sisters: Carlota Zamora, of Calle Crespo; Mar&#237;a Teresa Bordas, of Tabaco, province of Albay; Fabiana Robledo, wife of Sixto Celis; Lorenza Nepomuceno, of Calle San Jos&#233;, Trozo; Angelica Lopez, Calle Jolo; Narcisa Rizal; Mar&#237;a Dizon, Calle Trozo, and other fanatic females.
</p><p>Villaruel was the Gr&#8756; Oriente of filipino masonry, a deluded fanatic, a man of but scarce intellectual endowments, an instrument of those who knew more and were shrewder than he. By laying hands upon him the Spanish Authorities laid hands also upon a large number of incriminating documents which were the means of connecting many prominent business men of Manila with the <pb id="pb130" n="130"/>bloody programme of the Katipunan. Among these was Francisco L. Roxas.
</p><p>Besides these documents were a large number of loose papers written <corr sic="is">in</corr> <corr sic="tagalog">Tagalog</corr>, in which were discovered many threatening phrases and the expression of hopes in the success of an event to take place in the near future. Masks and other masonic implements, including a heavily made and sharply pointed dagger were also discovered.
</p><p>Previous to suffering the <corr sic="penality">penalty</corr> of his treason he made and signed a public abjuration, for the copy of which see Appendix <ref target="appe">E</ref>.


</p><p id="n16"><hi rend="sc">Note 16.</hi> Andr&#233;s Bonifacio was the soul of the Katipunan movement; he was the President of the &#8220;Council of Ministers of the Supreme Popular Council.&#8221; His social condition was of a low grade, that grade from which many of the most fanatical pseudo-reformers have come; he was a warehouseman, a porter. In this capacity he was employed in the establishment of Messrs Fressel and Co., and was one of the humblest of the employees.
</p><p>Bonifacio was, however, very vain and quixotic. He was, too, a man of sanguinary character, and held the people over whom <pb id="pb131" n="131"/>he attained ascendancy, in awe. His ambition was the cause of his ignominious downfall and brutal murder at the hands of another self-asserted dictator of the filipino Commune. Like most of his kind, he was a great reader, and by those who knew him best he was likened to Don Quixote, for like that worthy he passed many a night burning away oil and candles, and sacrificing needed sleep in reading, until his brain was turned and his whole mind given up to ideas of revolutions. His favorite study was the French Revolution, from the which he learned many lessons which he utilized in his projects, the principal of which was the formation of a government after the style of the French Commune. He was astute and comparatively intelligent, and spoke the <corr sic="tagalog">Tagalog</corr> dialect well. For the carrying out of his plans he had agents in every nook and corner. No place <corr sic="were">where</corr> information might be gathered or the work of propaganda done, was over-looked. The offices of the Civil Government had their quota of his spies, as also did the <foreign lang="es" xml:lang="es">Intendencia</foreign>, the <foreign lang="es" xml:lang="es">Maestraza de Artilleria</foreign> and the other large centers. Nor were the Convents and Colleges overlooked, nor even <pb id="pb132" n="132"/>the big business Corporations.
</p><p>Bonifacio enjoyed an envied ascendancy over the lower classes and the ignorant. Like others of similar tendencies, Bonifacio knew how to exploit the &#8220;membership&#8221;. He was at one time treasurer of the Katipunan, and upon one occasion after the examination of the books by the president of the society Andr&#233;s was denounced as an exploiter, the accounts being found in a very bad condition. A series of mutual squabbles and insults passed between the president Roman Basa, and Bonifacio, the whole affair ending up in a re-election of officers, Bonifacio being chosen as president. This occurred towards the end of the year 1893.
</p><p>The vanity of Bonifacio was comparable only to that of Aguinaldo. Among the number of chief workers of the Katipunan was a certain Valenzuela, a doctor who had, according to his own confession, been forced into the membership by Bonifacio, on the strength of a &#8220;love&#8221; affair; he was given the choice of membership or death. He chose the <corr sic="latter">former</corr> but later on resigned. Whilst a member he enjoyed a salary of 30 pesos a month as medical officer, but only with difficulty could he collect his pay. He claimed <pb id="pb133" n="133"/>to have been exploited by Bonifacio who, whilst merely a porter, could thus have at his command the free services of a real doctor, spurning the services of the petty physicians which abound in Manila. Nor was this all. His own (Bonifacio&#8217;s) house having been burned down, he went, on the strength of this same &#8220;love&#8221; affair, to live in the house of the said doctor (see foot-note p. 48), taking with him his paramour, the doctor paying the greater part of the expenses thus incurred.
</p><p>At the time of the organization of the popular Supreme Councils, Bonifacio was chosen president of the Council of Trozo; but in consequence of internal troubles occasioned by his rebelliousness, the Supreme Council decided to dissolve the local Council. Bonifacio, true to his colors, disregarded this order and continued working on his own account, taking upon himself the faculties of the Supreme Council.
</p><p>He preserved in a case which was found in the warehouse of Messrs Fressel and Co., the organization of the &#8220;Filipino Republic&#8221; which was to be, as well as a number of regulations, codes, decrees of nominations, etc., all drawn up in Tagalog (see foot-note p. 49.)
<pb id="pb134" n="134"/></p><p>Upon the discovery, on the 19th of August 1896, by the Augustinian Padre fray Mariano Gil, parish priest of Tondo, of the plot of the <hi>Katipuneros</hi>, Bonifacio and his immediate assistants fled from Manila to Caloocan. From that point he sent orders to the provinces of Manila, Cavite and Nueva Ecija that a general rising should take place on the 30th of that month. These orders were given out of revenge for the failure of the blood-thirsty plot whereby every Spaniard, man, woman or child should share in the sufferings which his diseased brain had concocted for those who should fall into his hands. Bonifacio issued special orders concerning the Governor General, his plan being that he and the other Spanish authorities of any importance should be taken prisoners, but not killed, it being intended to hold their persons as security for the granting of their demands. He called together the members of the Junta Superior and nominated a general-in-chief, a general of division and other officials. These however refused to step into the places he had prepared for them and Bonifacio angered thereat threatened to have the head removed from the shoulders of anyone who dared to disobey him. <pb id="pb135" n="135"/>The general-in-chief Teodoro Plata, a cousin of Bonifacio, fled during the night following his nomination, whereupon Bonifacio issued orders for his capture, commanding his death wherever he should be found.
</p><p>Sometime previous to this, about the month of May, Bonifacio sent Pio Valenzuela to Dapitan to hold a conference with Rizal concerning the convenience of immediate rebellion against Spain. Rizal would not consent to the projected revolt but opposed the idea most strenuously, being thrown into such a bad humor by the information he received of Bonifacio, that Valenzuela, who had gone to Dapitan intending to spend a month there, determined to return on the following day. On his return to Manila he recounted to Bonifacio the result of his mission. Bonifacio who knew Rizal&#8217;s influence over the people to be greater than his own, had been living in hopes of receiving Rizal&#8217;s consent which would be the surrendering to him of the whole responsibility and glory of the bloody enterprise. Bonifacio aspired to the absolute, like all the so-called leaders of the revolt; so when he realized the stand taken by Rizal, who was willing to wait patiently till the poison with which he had inoculated <pb id="pb136" n="136"/>the people should work of itself, he flew into a rage like a spoilt child, declaring Rizal to be a coward and imposing upon Valenzuela, his messenger, implicit silence on this subject, prohibiting him from manifesting to anyone what he considered to be the bad exit of the consultation.
</p><p>No methods were too underhand for Bonifacio; to gain his end he lied to the people over whom he held sway as only a <corr sic="filipino">Filipino</corr> can lie. On one occasion he affirmed that in Coregidor was a vessel loaded with arms and ammunition for the rebels, and by this means he animated them, a very necessary thing at that time, as they were but scantily armed with bolos and were no match against those they intended to assail.
</p><p>Taking him all in all, Bonifacio was a first class organizer for such an enterprise as that aimed at by the Katipunan, and upon his shoulders lies the weight of the greater part of the iniquities of the diabolical society.

He had rivals in the field however, the most powerful being Aguinaldo, the would be <pb id="pb137" n="137"/>president of the mushroom republic. After the encounter at San Juan del Monte in which the insurgents suffered the loss of 95 killed and 42 taken prisoners in the first instance, and shortly afterwards of 200 more, Bonifacio escaped, carrying with him the funds of the Katipunan, some 20,000 pfs.<note n="a">Pedro Gonzales, a native who was captured whilst carrying dispatches and letters to and fro between Manila and the insurgent camp, was a man well posted in the doings of the rebels and was able to give much interesting and valuable information to the Authorities.

In this matter of the flight of Bonifacio he stated that &#8220;it was not exact as had been said, that <corr sic="Andres">Andr&#233;s</corr> Bonifacio was in Cavite (at that particular time), for after the defeat at San Juan del Monte he disappeared with the funds of the Katipunan, which amounted to some 20,000 pesos, as he had been assured.&#8221;</note> He was supposed to be in hiding in the most <corr sic="inaccesible">inaccessible</corr> parts of the mountains of San Mateo, in as much as he had told Pio Valenzuela that in case the movement were unsuccessful he had determined to retire to that point to devote himself to highway robbery<note n="b">Having been asked during his trial whether he was aware of the hiding place of Bonifacio, Valenzuela (fol. 600 to 605) stated that &#8220;he was not aware of the place in which Bonifacio and <pb/>others were to be met with; that he merely supposed that Bonifacio could be found in the mountains of San Mateo, in Tapusi, in other words in the most inaccessible part of the said mountain range; because the witness heard him say that <hi>he would retire to that point to dedicate himself to highway robbery if the movement should not be successful</hi>.</note>, to foot-padding, an idea gotten <pb id="pb138" n="138"/>from some modern French novel probably.

Till that time he was like many others of the same class almost unknown.


</p><p id="n19"><hi rend="sc">Note 19.</hi> The character of the native: this is a subject upon which one might write many volumes without conveying to the minds of his readers more than a faint idea of what that strange character is.
</p><p>More mysterious than the most profound mystery of Religion, his most striking trait of character being a decided <corr sic="tendancy">tendency</corr> to retrogression, the Malay stands out among the numerous divisions of the human family as a man with a marked propensity to the mysterious, to the prodigious. He is accustomed to give a blind obedience to his superiors and more so to his own caciques, he is docile as a general rule, and shows but <pb id="pb140" n="140"/>little resentment to abusive language, although he will sometimes carefully guard the <corr sic="rememberance">remembrance</corr> of some insignificant insult or blow, and take a cruel revenge, a thousand times greater than the injury he received, after a period, at times, of years. Other peculiarities of the native are his delight in gambling and cockfighting, his aversion to manual labor, his infantile but excessive vanity, his lack of the power of thought in matters of moment, his well developed imagination, his instability from all points of view and his liability to complete and radical changes. The average indian is to-day virtuous, honest and grateful for favors received, tomorrow he is vicious, <corr sic="theiving">thieving</corr> and shows an ingratitude not to be found even in the brute creation. This very marked trait of character may be found in many of the <corr sic="filipinos">Filipinos</corr> who have held and still hold some of the highest official positions in the islands.
</p><p>To sum up the <corr sic="filipino">Filipino</corr> indian in a few words: he is inexplicable. There have been those who have spent their lives in the study of the indian, but in spite of all that man can do to study man, the problem remains unsolved. Only those &#8220;globe trotters&#8221; <pb id="pb141" n="141"/>who have studied the native from the <hi lang="es" xml:lang="es">muchacho</hi> who waited upon them at the hotel at which they stayed during their few days visit, and the <hi lang="es" xml:lang="es">cochero</hi> who had the honor of conducting such <hi lang="es" xml:lang="es">savants</hi> to and from the Luneta, have so far been able to demonstrate what is this character which has puzzled men of common sense and lifelong experience, for centuries.
</p><p>Being by nature credulous, ignorant and superstitious, the indian fell an easy victim to the mysteries of freemasonry, which served him as are introduction to the semi-savage methods of the &#8220;Liga Filipina&#8221; and the barbarous practices of the Katipunan, the <hi lang="es" xml:lang="es">pacto-de-sangre</hi> of which, carried him back to the savage times of his remote ancestors who were drawn from their mountain and forest lairs and domesticated by the Religious Orders.

He says that this Council continues working well for some few months, at the end of which all the enthusiasm of the founders vanishes and....

</p><p id="n24"><hi rend="sc">Note 24.</hi> La Solidaridad was the official organ of <corr sic="filipino">Filipino</corr> freemasonry in all its branches. Although it was published in the peninsula its circulation was intended for the Philippines. Its editors were the leaders of the disaffection against the metropolis <pb id="pb143" n="143"/>and stout advocates, indirectly, of an impossible independence. The chief aim of the paper was to mortify everything Spanish, and to this end its columns were continually full of seditious articles aimed, not merely at individuals but at the State. Its diatribes against the Government of the Metropolis were of the bitterest nature, and therefore but little publicity was given to the sheet in Madrid, where it was printed. It enjoyed no exchange with the periodicals of importance of the city, had no street sales, nor was it exposed for sale publicly. The libraries did not carry it on their tables and it never reached the hands of the public authorities. In fact the people of the official element know nothing of its existence.
</p><p>In the office of this bi-monthly paper was established a freemason lodge bearing the same name as the paper; all the members of the Association Hispano-Filipina became members of the lodge. Being the organ of masonry as well as of separatism it was introduced into the Archipelago and secured a free circulation in all parts of the principal islands where its calumnies against the Religious Orders had the effect of producing a decided effect upon the maintenance <pb id="pb144" n="144"/>of public order.
</p><p>The statement that the bi-monthly was founded by Pilar is erroneous; it was first published by Lopez Jaena in Barcelona where it enjoyed its enforced life till it reached its number 18, of October 1889, when it suddenly ceased publication on account of the seizure by the authorities of a number of incriminating documents and pamphlets. It recommenced publication in Madrid on the 15th of November of the same year. It was later on acquired by Pilar and Morayta<corr>.</corr> It was in reality a vent for the spleen of its writers against Spain and things Spanish; it was a precursor of the <hi lang="es" xml:lang="es">Independencia</hi><note n="a">See foot-note page 114.</note> the official organ of the Revolution against the U.

<pb id="pb145" n="145"/></p><p id="n25"><hi rend="sc">Note 25.</hi> One of the first propagators of <corr sic="filipino">Filipino</corr> masonry was Sr. Centeno, Civil Governor of Manila, a man of anything but happy memory for this country<note n="a">See page 60.</note>. Centeno and Quiroga Ballesteros worked hard to undermine the beneficial influence of the Clergy, an influence which was the safe-guard of law and order. Their most famous piece of work was the manifestation of &#8217;88 against Archbishop Payo (See note <ref target="n2">2</ref>). In that manifestation was conceived the cry of sedition which was later on to ring throughout the archipelago and tear down the banner of the fatherland to replace it with the red flag of anarchy; a flag which well nigh brought the people of a would be independent country to the verge of political and moral destruction.


</p><p id="n26"><hi rend="sc">Note 26.</hi> No sooner had Almighty God consummated the grand work of the creation, the culmination of which was the breathing into man of an immortal soul, than the devil, the father of evil, jealous <corr sic="of of">of</corr> the attributes given by God to man, made his bold attempt to destroy God&#8217;s immortal work. From that moment to this present the <pb id="pb146" n="146"/>spirits of evil have carried on an <corr sic="inceasing">unceasing</corr> warfare against what has been for the glory of God. The Monastic Orders ever since <corr sic="the the">the</corr> days of their birth have had to contend against these powers of evil; and there is therefore little necessity for surprise that those who were employed in such work as were the unscrupulous persons who came to the archipelago to sow ruin in the consciences of the people and scandal in society, should carry on a bitter campaign against the Religious Orders to whom was owing every jot and tittle of the civilization and culture enjoyed by the <corr sic="filipinos">Filipinos</corr>. The Monastic Orders have ever been the bulwark of Christianity, and as such have had to bear the brunt of the battle. Europe owes the solid foundation of its political, social and religious life to the Religious Orders, which, during the ages in which the Huns, Goths and other barbarians overran and devastated those lands, hoarded up in the nooks and corners of their monastic dwellings the seed which, when afterwards sown, was to become the stout tree of civilization which should spread its sheltering branches to the four corners of the earth. One of these branches drawing its <corr sic="fulness">fullness</corr> of life <pb id="pb147" n="147"/>and <corr sic="vigour">vigor</corr> directly from the trunk, extended to these far off islands and, casting its shade over the embruted mankind here existing at that time, wrought a change over it no less marked than that wrought over the European peoples. From the day in which Father Urdaneta, that intrepid Augustinian, set foot upon Philippine soil<corr sic=".">,</corr> till the day upon which the hydra-headed Katipunan appeared in the land, the Monastic Orders have been the one great source of all that was really useful and beneficial to the inhabitants of the archipelago, although at times the moral interests of the people were not the commercial interests of the country.
</p><p>The &#8220;friar&#8221; so much slandered by those who wish to overthrow his <corr sic="beneficient">beneficent</corr> influence, ever carried the banner of his country enlaced with the Cross of the Redeemer. He came to the Archipelago as a messenger of peace and order, and was the strongest supporter of the sovereignty of his nation. The &#8220;friar&#8221; was hated because he was the one who best knew and understood the indian, and from his intimate knowledge of his <corr sic="parishoners">parishioners</corr>, could the more easily detect anything on their part which tended to the detriment of the <corr sic="entegrity">integrity</corr> of <pb id="pb148" n="148"/>the Spanish sovereignty.
</p><p>The <corr sic="compaign">campaign</corr> against the Religious Orders was the attack of the battering-rams against the city to be captured. By piercing the wall the entry into the city could be the easier made; and this the separatist element well knew, hence all their efforts were directed against the stout wall which defended from its assaults the treasure <corr sic="of of">of</corr> the metropolis.
</p><p>For three hundred years the Philippines remained submitted to Spain exclusively by reason of the moral influence of the Clergy. Whilst the banner of Spain, floated over the Archipelago, the Religious formed the strongest guard for its protection; when it fell, strung by the ingratitude and treachery of those who had sworn to defend it to the last drop of their blood, and lay dishonored in the dust, it was the Religious who bowed his head in the deepest grief and who shed the bitterest tears. When the flag of the conquerer was hauled up to the height from which once gloriously floated the symbol of Spanish authority, the Religious, obedient to the commands of his superiors, withdrew to the solicitude of his convent, to await in patience, the <pb id="pb149" n="149"/>passing of the storm. He looks out upon the clouded political horizon, as Noah looked out from the window of the ark upon the vast sea of waters which hid from his view the fearful <corr sic="distruction">destruction</corr> which had overcome the world, patiently awaiting the time when he should, at God&#8217;s will, go forth to commence again the work of reconstruction.
</p><p>Often have I heard the opinion expressed that the Government&#8217;s worst enemy is the &#8220;friar&#8221;, that it is the &#8220;friar&#8221; who keeps alive the spirit of rebellion. Let those <corr sic="who who">who</corr> think thus, ponder over one small thought: what has the friar to gain in sustaining a rebellion which has caused him more moral and material damage, than has been caused to any other entity in the Philippines? To those who are able and willing to utilize the power of thought with which God has endowed them, it is sufficiently clear that the Religious has nothing to gain by such tactics, but, on the contrary, all to lose.
</p><p>In Spanish times the native enemies of the Religious Orders were the enemies of Spain and in these days, the enemy of the friar is by no means a real friend, whatever he may claim to be, of the Government of <pb id="pb150" n="150"/>of the U. S. The Spanish masons and the <corr sic="filipino">Filipino</corr> separatists found the friar to be the greatest obstacle to be encountered. <corr sic="&#8216;">&#8220;</corr>The friar,&#8221; wrote Governor D. Francisco Borrero, to Sr. Canovas, in a memoir concerning the Archipelago, &#8220;knowing the language, spirit, and <corr sic="tendancies">tendencies</corr> of the natives, is considered as the principal obstacle for the realization of the filibuster idea, and hence arises their aspiration (that of the enemies of Spain) that the Religious Orders should be eliminated, because such a step being taken, they believe they will have travelled half the journey....&#8221;
</p><p>The propaganda of Universal freemasonry, of <corr sic="filipino">Filipino</corr> freemasonry, of the Liga Filipina, of the Compromisarios, was aimed principally at the Religious Orders, but the results attained were but introductory to the real work of the Katipunan, which, finding itself cornered by the discovery of the plot it had concocted against the Government, showed its hand. Its aim was anti-Spanish and not merely anti-friar, as is sufficiently clear from the fact that in all the documents of the diabolical association it is death to <hi>all the Spaniards</hi>, and not to this or that class. Moreover in many cases the same <pb id="pb151" n="151"/>Katipuneros saved their parish priests from a sure death whilst they dealt out anything but kind treatment to those of the Civil Guard (<corr sic="filipinos">Filipinos</corr>) and the Spanish troops who fell into their hands. The friars who were murdered by the rebels were not murdered for being friars but because they were Spaniards. The documents captured, the result of the trials held in judgement of persons guilty of treason, show clearly that the revolution was for the purpose of gaining the independence of the country from Spain, and not merely to bring about the expulsion of the Religious Orders. Aguinaldo, the leader of the Katipunan <corr sic="hoardes">hordes</corr>, desired to send the friars who fell prisoners into his hands, over to <corr sic="Hong-kong">Hong-Kong</corr>, where they would be at liberty to return to their own country; but this merciful desire of his was overruled by his advisers, among whom were numbered Mabini his right hand man, Pardo de Tavera, Legarda and Buencamino, all three of them traitors to the cause of independence. To-day they stand in positions of honor, honor which they have done nothing to deserve, whilst Aguinaldo who was the tool of political schemers, their play-thing, is cast into disgrace and kept in the <pb id="pb152" n="152"/>background, a scape-goat for the sins and shortcomings of men whose names disgrace the darkest pages of Philippine history.


</p><p id="n27"><hi rend="sc">Note 27.</hi> Vast numbers of these documents were later on destroyed in the hope that certain affairs of an anti-patriotic nature might be hushed up, and many persons of a high official standing saved from scandal. Padre Mariano Gil, O. S. A., who made known to the public authorities the fearful plot of the Katipunan in time to prevent the brutal murder of hundreds of Spaniards, was granted certified copies of a large number (all the principal ones) of the documents and these have been since preserved with the greatest care, and remain to-day as a standing proof of the duplicity of many persons who live in ignorance of the fact of the existence of the said certified copies.

The campaign at this present carried on by some of the filipino and Spanish papers, and, in contradiction to the fundamental principles of Americanism, by the local American press also, is but a sequel to the work of this committee of propaganda. The calumnies which are literally crammed into the columns of Manila&#8217;s English speaking daily and weekly press are but a poor reproduction of the vicious publications distributed throughout the archipelago since the year 1888. For fourteen years have these calumnies been published, but in spite of countless challenges, never have the statements brought forward been backed up with even the shadow of proof. When almighty God completed his creation by the making of man and woman, he led them to Eden, placing them under his law. Then it was that the devil beguiled them with lying words: &#8220;For God doth know that in that day that you shall eat thereof <pb id="pb154" n="154"/>(of the forbidden fruit) your eyes shall be opened, and you shall be as Gods knowing good and evil.&#8221; From that day to this, this same argument that the devil used to try to prove that God was withholding from the people what was to their benefit, is being to-day used by certain of the offspring of that evil spirit against the element of good, against the Religious Orders, the servants of God, claiming that they held from the people of this Archipelago that which was for their good and advancement. Adam and Eve found to their bitter cost that the devil lied: those who are to-day being misled by anti-friar calumny will make the same discovery in due time.

Many of the wealthy element of Luzon and other islands of the group, were forced by threats and compromises into position they had no <pb id="pb155" n="155"/>desire to occupy.

He was, as he himself confesses, always well received in the pueblos, and greeted by the parish priests (friars) and lodged in the convents free of cost. Although Foreman did not perform vile practical jokes upon unsuspecting and <corr sic="innoffensive">inoffensive</corr> hosts as did the now &#8220;commissioner&#8221; Worcester in his travels, he did many things no honorable man would have done. Although he professed himself a Catholic it was only for &#8220;business&#8221; purposes; one has only to read the preface to his book to find that out.
</p><p>Foreman was an Englishman, disliked by the English, <pb/>despised by everyone he came in contact with; and if the things said of him by his intimate acquaintances, are true, then he well deserved the snubs he has lately received all round.
</p><p>On the 17th of April 1899, before the members of the Schurman Commission, Neil Macleod testified of Foreman, as follows:
</p><p>Questioned by Worcester:
</p><p>Q. Have you read Foreman&#8217;s book?
</p><p>A. Yes; I know him personally.
</p><p>Q. Was he a Catholic?
</p><p>A. I do not know.
</p><p>Q. He says so?
</p><p>A. Yes.
</p><p>Q. He is an engineer, isn&#8217;t he?
</p><p>A. He has been here frequently travelling all over the country, selling machinery.
</p><p>Q. You know he attacks the Church?
</p><p>A. He attacks the church very much, and he ought to be very thankful to the priests, for they have been very good to him; ...

</p><p>considering that he availed himself of their services and hospitality all over the country, he should have thought twice before <corr sic="puttting">putting</corr> a <hi>thing</hi> like that (his history) into print.&#8221;
</p><p>Worcester was fishing for trout and caught a crab. He got enough <corr sic="aud">and</corr> the subject ... suddenly changed.</p></note>, Blumentritt claimed to be a fervent <pb id="pb160" n="160"/>Catholic and yet was an open enemy of the Church. He claimed moreover to be a great friend of Spain and yet openly sided with her enemies. He was one of the <corr sic="colaborators">collaborators</corr> of the <hi lang="es" xml:lang="es">La Solidaridad</hi>.
</p><p>Isabelo de los Reyes writes of him: &#8220;The <pb id="pb161" n="161"/>savant (sic) Blumentritt the <hi>brother</hi> of the <corr sic="filipinos">Filipinos</corr>, has always served us with disinterest (except in what concerned his pocket) and opportuneness. He was the first who did us justice by publishing many valuable articles to demonstrate, under all points of view, the superiority of the <corr sic="filipino">Filipino</corr> (Isabelo does not say over what) and defending our cause against the ambition of the imperialists (that is the Spaniards).&#8221;
</p><p>Blumentritt was a member of the society known as the &#8220;<foreign lang="es" xml:lang="es">Amigos del Pais</foreign>&#8221;<note n="a">See <corr sic="Apendix">Appendix</corr> <ref target="appg">G</ref>.</note>, and remained so till his actions and writings caused well thinking Spaniards and <corr sic="philippinos">Philippinos</corr><note n="b"><sic>Philippinos</sic>: insular Spaniards, or Spaniards born in the Philippines. Filipino: more commonly known as <hi lang="es" xml:lang="es">indio</hi>: that is, an indian native of the Archipelago.</note> to call for his dismissal from its membership. The patriotic outcry against him caused him to resign on the 14th of November 1889; the Solidaridad of the 31st of December of the same year published his resignation. The press of Manila was exceptionally bitter against him and only such <corr sic="filipinos">Filipinos</corr> as those who continue up to the present time forming part of the <hi>juntas</hi> in <pb id="pb162" n="162"/>Hong-Kong, Madrid, Paris, London and other places looked up to him for the assistance they could not find at home.


</p><p id="n37"><hi rend="sc">Note 37.</hi> It was naturally in the <corr sic="Peninsular">Peninsula</corr> where the chief work of the propaganda had to be carried on, and it was there also that the propaganda had the least effect. The principal instrument for the <corr sic="desemination">dissemination</corr> of the seed of separatist aspirations was the <hi lang="es" xml:lang="es">Solidaridad</hi> (See note <ref target="n24">24</ref>). The <corr sic="filipinos">Filipinos</corr> here, who gave their subscriptions and other sums of money for the support of the bi-monthly, were kept under the impression that the official organ was making a great noise in Madrid; but as it never reached the official world it was supposed to influence, its publication was practically useless. In the Philippines it served the same purpose as the <hi lang="es" xml:lang="es">La Independencia</hi>: that is, it served to keep alive the spirit of unrest, and by the lies it published, made the people believe that their leaders were going to lead them to a promised land which &#8220;flowed with milk and honey.&#8221; They eventually got into the promised land, only to find that the milk was very much &#8220;condensed&#8221;, and that the honey was only to be <corr sic="gotten">got</corr> after <pb id="pb163" n="163"/>those who secured it had been exposed to the very unpleasant operation of being stung by the bees which produced it.
</p><p>Instead of serving to keep together the subjects and their rulers in a bond of peace and tranquility, and helping them to come to a mutual understanding, in which state the progress and advancement of the islands and their inhabitants could be the easier and the better accomplished, the separatist element, by their propaganda, caused more and more strife by attacking national institutions and by casting slurs upon national honor. The discontent stirred up against the Spanish authorities was identical to that which, until the passing of the law of sedition and even since that time, was stirred up against the American sovereignty. In its propaganda against the Religious Orders, inciting the native clergy against the lawful authority of their Bishops, it was the precursor of modern Manila&#8217;s American press. History tells us what was the result of the lessening of the moral influence of the Religious Orders in the days of Spanish rule, and to-day History repeats itself. The inciting of the native clergy against their Bishops is encouraging the natives, as a whole, to resist <pb id="pb164" n="164"/>lawful authority. The cry to-day is &#8220;down with the friar,&#8221; tomorrow it will be &#8220;down with the American.<corr>&#8221;</corr> In 1888 it was down with the Religious Orders, in 1896 it had become &#8220;death to all Spaniards&#8221;. In 1898 the American was blessed as a deliverer from oppression, in 1899 cursed as an intruder. To-day...? Who knows the opinion of the people? Who but a few <hi lang="es" xml:lang="es">ignorantes</hi> trust the great men of the late revolution?
</p><p>In Spain the work of the <corr sic="seperatists">separatists</corr> produced no effect upon the people; a few here and there of the least patriotic of the scum of Barcelona and Madrid aided them but apart from these and the Bible Societies, no one interested themselves in their cause.


</p><p id="n39"><hi rend="sc">Note 39.</hi> From the earliest to the latest days of the period of the revolt, that is from &#8217;88 to &#8217;98, this was one of the greatest obstacles to be overcome. Money was collected for propaganda in Spain and in Japan; what became of it all? Money was collected for the purpose of releasing or stealing away Rizal; what became of it?

But when the oppression is imaginary and when the so-called hero is but a marionette in the hands of political schemers who seek their own advantage under the shelter of a pretence to throw off a yoke which does not exist, one cannot admire the part played by the deluded &#8220;tool&#8221;.

</p><p>Pio Valenzuela in recounting the forms and ceremonies practiced upon his initiation, said:
</p><p>&#8220;Once in the house<note n="a">He was conducted from calle Iris blindfolded in a <hi lang="es" xml:lang="es">quilez</hi> (a vehicle of the country) to a house which he later on discovered to be that of Bonifacio, situated in calle Oroquieta.</note>, they spoke of many things, <hi>en r&#233;sum&#233;</hi>, that the aim of <pb id="pb171" n="171"/>the association was to obtain the independence of the Philippines, oppressed and enslaved by the Spaniards. Placing, later on, a dagger at his breast, they obliged him to throw himself upon it, a thing which the witness could not pluck up courage enough to do; whereupon they placed it in his hand, leading him to a man whom he recognized to be seated, and ordered him (the witness) to strike him with the dagger, a thing which he dare not do either. He was then conducted into a room and addressed by a person he knew to be Bonifacio by the voice, who informed him that he could not retrace his steps because he knew of the existence of the society, but he could not assist at the <hi>juntas</hi> nor could they teach him the signs of recognition till he had been re-initiated; they moreover made him sign two sheets of blank paper, causing him to swear never to reveal the existence of the society to anyone, under the pain of <corr sic="asssasination">assassination</corr>. They then removed the bandage which he was blindfolded and he saw around him eight or nine individuals dressed in cloaks and hoods; he signed the two sheets of paper and was again blindfolded and conducted to a considerable distance from the <pb id="pb172" n="172"/>house where the bandage was again removed.
</p><p>Another member of the Katipunan in his declaration made on the 22nd of September 1896, stated that during the month of February 1893, one Sunday morning, a certain Estanislao Legaspi entered his store, telling him to accompany him in a <hi lang="es" xml:lang="es">calesa</hi><corr sic=",">.</corr> He listened to tirades against the Spanish Government till their arrival at the house of a certain Tranquilino Torres, in calle Elcano<corr>.</corr> Here &#8220;his eyes were bandaged by Legaspi and he was handed over to the care of another individual who conducted him to the upper story of the house and made him sit down; he then heard a person whom he knew to be Legaspi by his voice speak, saying several things against the Spanish Government, demanding of him an oath of blind obedience, and a defense of the Philippines till the shedding of the last drop of his blood, threatening him with fearful punishments if he should turn traitor. This ceremony being terminated, his eyes were unbound and he saw, on a table, a skull which they made him kiss, and Legaspi handed him a lance commanding him to wound himself in the arm; but he felt a feeling of <pb id="pb173" n="173"/>faintheartedness come over him, and manifested to those present that he had not courage enough to wound himself and wished that the oath he had taken be enough; he was dispensed from the operation. When the bandage was removed the eight individuals composing the <hi lang="es" xml:lang="es">junta</hi> were masked with black hoods, but after he kissed the skull and attempted to wound himself they removed the hoods and he then recognized Estanislao Legaspi who presided, Mariano de Vera, Teodoro Plata and Juan de la Cruz who was a clerk of the Tabacalera, and who had led him upstairs; he did not know the other three. The witness paid two pesos as entrance fee promising to pay 50 cents monthly. He asked Legaspi what association it was, and he replied that it was the <hi lang="es" xml:lang="es">Liga Filipina</hi>.&#8221;

</p><p>&#8220;The person who desires to enter the lodge is obliged to have his face covered and his eyes bandaged in sign of blind obedience; the proofs are carried out and signature made as follows.

</p><p id="n53"><hi rend="sc">Note 53.</hi> Rizal had money troubles previously with Pilar in Madrid (see note 39). The excessive earnest and zeal displayed at the time of the foundation of the <hi>Liga</hi> by Rizal died away on his deportation. This zeal was owing to the captivating manner in which the founder demonstrated to his audience the brilliant future to be attained by such an undertaking. Rizal had the advantage of a ready oratory and like Bonifacio, drew his hearers to his cause in spite of themselves. And then again, the same as in masonry, the association was secret, and its true end and aim were but whispered; and whilst many of the associated were laboring to assist, as they thought, in the fomentation of the <pb id="pb177" n="177"/>culture and advancement of the country, they were in reality playing with the toy <corr sic="alloted">allotted</corr> to them by the society, whilst the chief members, those members <hi>best suited to be masons</hi>, as says the Gr&#8756; Sec&#8756; of the Gr&#8756; Or&#8756; Esp&#8756;<note n="a">In an official letter of the Grand Secretary of the Oriente Espa&#241;ol to the Lodge <hi>Nilad</hi>, dated Madrid 8th of June 1892, the secretary, warning the said lodge to be careful in the performance of its labors says: &#8220;... not all men, although they profess our ideas and doctrines, serve for good masons.&#8221;</note>, carried on the true work of the <hi>Liga</hi>. As in the lower degrees of any secret society, and of masonry in particular, the members are unaware of what is aimed at in the degrees to which they have not attained, to which all cannot attain, and the secrets of which are zealously guarded, so it was in the <hi>Liga</hi>.
</p><p>Upon its re-establishment the Liga counted among its members several who aimed at the leadership. The absence of Rizal, deported to Dapitan, left open the door for unbridled ambition. Everyone wanted to be the head. This together with money troubles brought about considerable ill feeling between the absent founder and those continuing the work of the association. Rizal <pb id="pb178" n="178"/>had so far kept up a continual secret communication with the Liga, thanks to the liberty allowed him by his keepers in Mindanao, who guarded him with scandalous carelessness; and thanks also to the <corr sic="emisaries">emissaries</corr> sent to him from Manila in search of instructions and advice.

</p><p>On January 11th Gov. Gen. Polavieja telegraphed to Madrid as follows:
</p><p>&#8220;Sentenced by council of War, to-day there have been executed (shot) twelve persons <pb id="pb182" n="182"/>guilty of treason ... among them Francisco Roxas, Councillor of Administration; Nijaga, Lieut. of native infantry; <sic>Villaroel</sic>, Villareal, Moises Salvador and others.&#8221;
<milestone unit="tb"/>
</p><p>Pedro Roxas was also a millionaire who inherited a good fortune, which, under the shelter of official protection multiplied considerably. Spain honored him with the grand cross of Isabela la Cat&#243;lica. Like Francisco he was a Councillor of Administration. He possessed a large estate in Nasugbu which, when the revolt broke out, became an insurgent hornet&#8217;s nest. There the rebels had a cannon, three falconettes and a large number of arms.
</p><p>After having been deprived of his office by decree previously mentioned, Pedro Roxas secured in some way or other from Blanco, permission to go to Spain. On arrival at Singapore he landed and remained there. Later on he was defended in the Spanish Cort&#233;s by Sr. Romero Robledo<note n="a">See Appendix <ref target="appi">I</ref>.</note>. In Manila, to those who could judge of the facts on the spot, this defence came as a thunderbolt. However, the Spanish paper <hi lang="es" xml:lang="es">El <pb id="pb183" n="183"/>Correo</hi> in the issue of August 15th said:
</p><p>&#8220;The conduct of Sr. Roxas results satisfactorily cleared, so that no doubt remains in respect to his complete disconnection with the revolt.&#8221;
</p><p>Among the separatist element Pedro Roxas was known as the Emperor Pedro I.


</p><p id="n57"><hi rend="sc">Note 57.</hi> Maximo M. A. Paterno was the father of the well known Pedro Paterno<corr sic=",">.</corr> Maximo was in his latter days the leading spirit of the celebrations held in honor of the amnesty <corr sic="proclamed">proclaimed</corr> in 1900, by the late President McKinley. He died at the age of 76, just before the celebrations took place.
</p><p>This amnesty celebration, like most things attempted by <corr sic="filipinos">Filipinos</corr> alone, turned but a fiasco, the speeches which were to be delivered on the occasion not being in any way in keeping with the oath of allegiance taken by the speakers. The speeches contemplated were in advocation of practically the same thing as that for which the rebels had been keeping up an armed struggle, and so, when the U. S. Commission was invited by Pedro Paterno to be present thereat, it naturally was unable to accept the invitation.
<pb id="pb184" n="184"/></p><p>The whole celebration was an abortive attempt on the part of its organizers to antagonize the Military and Civil authorities. Mr. Taft, as president of the Commission, at first accepted the invitation extended, supposing the <corr sic="speaches">speeches</corr> to be given, had been censored by the proper authorities, at that time the military; but on finding that this was not so, he declined in the name of the other members of the Commission, and thus avoided the <corr sic="unpleasentness">unpleasantness</corr> of being present at a banquet at which both the Military and the Civil authorities would be insulted and the Government of the U. S. defied.
</p><p>On the 28th of July 1900, the day of the banquet, Mr. Taft on behalf of his fellow Commissioners, addressed a letter to Pedro Paterno on the subject. See Appendix <ref target="appj">J</ref>.
</p><p>Pedro Paterno was one of those who for a considerable time refused to take the oath of allegiance; with him were others, Mabini in particular.
</p><p>Maximo Paterno had received from Spain the Cross of Knight of the Royal and American Order of Isabela La Cat&#243;lica.

Of this latter Domingo Franco was asked during his trial, if Luis R. Yangco had assisted at any reunion of the <hi lang="es" xml:lang="es">compromisarios</hi>, to which he replied that he (Yangco) had not assisted at any session (fols. 1381&#8211;1382)<corr>.</corr>
</p><p>As I have already remarked in another note, many of those charged with complicity in the affairs of the revolt were latter on proved to be innocent. That considerable number of the wealthy natives and half-castes sympathised more or less with the idea of greater liberality in government, is undoubtedly true, but that they extended their sympathies to the aims of the hordes of cut-throats led by Bonifacio is absurd.
</p><p>The leading <corr sic="filipinos">Filipinos</corr> and many insular Spaniards sighed for privileges which the Government of Madrid did not deem well to concede. To bring pressure upon the Government some of these combined to support in the metropolis, some of their number who <pb id="pb186" n="186"/>should keep up the work of agitation. This agitation however took a form displeasing to many, who thereupon ceased to lend it their aid and consent. But few of the leaders of the people, especially of the wealthy ones, desired to cut themselves adrift from Spain, and not till a few insignificant beings such as Aguinaldo, Bonifacio, Mabini, and Pilar (Pio del) and Buencamino came upon the scene did the idea of independence of the island really take form. A faint idea of such a thing as independence did exist formerly, but the enlightened <corr sic="filipinos">Filipinos</corr> saw, only too clearly, the probable result.
</p><p>The wealthy proprietors here cited, no doubt sympathised more or less with the <hi>Liga Filipina</hi> in its beginning, whilst it was under the complete control of its founder Rizal; but as the <hi>Liga</hi> lost the character given to it by Rizal, and underwent the change it did, it is only natural to suppose that many of its former supporters left it as they would a sinking ship. However the fact that they were identified with the original <hi>Liga</hi> seems to have been taken as a proof of their connection with the revolt<corr sic=",">.</corr> This is certainly the opinion expressed by Sr. Diaz.


<pb id="pb187" n="187"/></p><p id="n59"><hi rend="sc">Note 59.</hi> Mactan is the name of the island upon which Magallanes, the famous explorer, met his death at the hands of the savage <corr sic="hoardes">hordes</corr> who at that time peopled the land. Names of places and persons associated with the disasters suffered by Spain, were greatly admired among the <corr sic="seperatists">separatists</corr>. Surely Mactan, an island peopled by savages at the time of its chief notoriety, and Mayon, the site of a destructive volcano, are very suitable names to give to such centers as were the popular councils of Trozo and Sta. Cruz.


</p><p id="n60"><hi rend="sc">Note 60.</hi> On the 30th of August 1895, the Civil Governor of Batangas asked of the commander of the Guardia Civil of Lemery, information concerning &#8220;persons in the pueblo of Taal who were distinguished for their <corr sic="seperatist">separatists</corr> opinions&#8221;. The said commander replied that a report on all such persons would be unending, and <corr sic="proceded">proceeded</corr> to cite the case of Felipe Agoncillo to <corr sic="personificy">personify</corr> the said <corr sic="seperatist">separatist</corr> element, as follows:
</p><p>&#8220;Among the group of the chief ones and as chief of them, stands Felipe Agoncillo, <corr sic="propritetor">proprietor</corr> and lawyer<corr>.</corr>&#8221; He then goes on to explain how Agoncillo imposed his will upon <pb id="pb188" n="188"/>every one in the pueblo, even upon the Municipality, no law or regulation sent even by the highest authorities going into force until it had been passed upon by him. &#8220;It would be difficult,&#8221; says he, &#8220;for me to collect any perfect proof of his anti-Spanish tendencies which are, however, self-evident to the Spanish element of this province<corr sic="&#8221;.">.&#8221;</corr> This report, which was a sufficient <corr sic="warningof">warning of</corr> danger, was sent to the Gov. of Batangas on the 18th of September 1895. He immediately forwarded it to Gen. Blanco. About three months afterwards Blanco looked into the matter, circumstances demanding that some steps should be taken to preserve national honor; and he decided to deport six of the <corr sic="seperatists">separatists</corr> as an example to the remainder. Of these six one was Agoncillo. This industrious filibuster had influential and <corr sic="watchfull">watchful</corr> friends in Manila, who, upon seeing the turn things were taking, telegraphed him &#8220;<foreign lang="es" xml:lang="es">Caf&#233; en baja; fuera existencias.</foreign>&#8221; This was warning sufficient and Agoncillo accompanied by Ramon Atienza succeeded in escaping.
</p><p>On the 14th of April the Japanese Mail Steamer Hiorine left Manila. On this steamer Agoncillo fled, hidden it is said, in a coal <pb id="pb189" n="189"/>bunk. The <hi lang="es" xml:lang="es">Heraldo de Madrid</hi> of the 16th of September 1896, in speaking of the affair says: &#8220;Agoncillo gave the captain of the ship the sum of 350 pesos as gratification and on this account had placed at his disposal upon arrival at Kobe, a ship&#8217;s boat, whilst the remaining passengers had to hire their transportation.&#8221;
</p><p>On the 2nd of May 1896, the secret police of Manila reported to Gen. Blanco, as follows:
</p><p>&#8220;Notice is hereby given of the sailing for Japan of Felipe Agoncillo, property-owner of the province of Batangas, who goes to put himself at the disposition of the junta magna (in Japan), carrying with him some 80,000 pesos collected in Lipa, Taal and other pueblos, for the sustainment of anti-Spanish propaganda.<corr>&#8221;</corr>
</p><p>Like most of the leaders of the separatist campaign, Agoncillo was astute. He partook of that peculiar trait of the native character: a sharpness of perception, a cuteness which one not acquainted with the indian would take for intelligence. An <corr sic="indian">Indian</corr> will often do something remarkable, but in spite of its appearance of being an extraordinary action, a result of a well thought <pb id="pb190" n="190"/>out plan, it proceeds in ninety-nine cases out of a hundred, from instinct rather from intelligence. Native peoples are more accustomed to use their common-sense than most of us and hence arises the fact, that frequently the <corr sic="filipino">Filipino</corr> has <corr sic="autwitted">outwitted</corr> both the military and the civil <corr sic="outhorities">authorities</corr>. England learned this lesson in dealing with the Oriental in India, Spain learned it here, and America has yet to discover the same truth.
</p><p>Mr. Wildman<note n="a"><p>Wildman will probably be long remembered by many who suffered brutalities and tortures at the hands of <corr sic="Agninaldo&#8217;s">Aguinaldo&#8217;s</corr> <corr sic="hoarde">horde</corr> of cut-throats, inspired by the late Consul&#8217;s advise.
</p><p>Correspondence took place between Aguinaldo and Wildman concerning the Spanish prisoners. In reply to a request of the <hi>Dictator</hi>, Wildman wrote:
</p><p>&#8220;Never mind feeding them. A meal every day, of course, and water will be <corr>a </corr>good diet. They have been living too high during the last few years. As the Spaniards want more bloodshed in the Philippines, <pb/>I trust you will let them have a taste of real war. Do not be so tender with them, etc., etc.<corr>&#8221;</corr>
</p><p>Little did Wildman think that the day would come when <corr sic="hese">these</corr> words of his would inspire equal or greater barbarity against his own countrymen.
</p><p>The publication of the valuable papers in Wildman&#8217;s <corr sic="possesion">possession</corr> at the time of his death in the shipwreck which occurred almost at the very door of his home would doubtless throw much light upon the past four years of Philippine history. The shipment of tons upon tons of ammunition, a large shipment of which left London on the &#8220;Inaba Maru,&#8221; on the 25th of September 1899, addressed to the &#8220;American Consul&#8221;, Hong-Kong, have yet to be accounted for.</p></note>, the late U. S. Consul at Hong-Kong, once affirmed of Agoncillo, &#8220;Sr. Agoncillo is a very intelligent and daring diplomat (the Government later on found him to be far more daring than intelligent), and could fill the position of chief of any department of State in any civilized country.&#8221; But then, it was nothing strange for Wildman to make such breaks!


<pb id="pb191" n="191"/></p><p id="n61"><hi rend="sc">Note 61.</hi> Among these honorable exceptions which Sr. Diaz says he has great pleasure in recognizing, might be mentioned several who were <corr sic="falsly">falsely</corr> accused and whose names have gone down to the reading public in the works of various writers who wrote in good faith, branded with the mark of ingratitude which characterized and still characterizes so many natives and half-castes.
</p><p>It gives a careful student of the subject more than passing pleasure to be able to give the lie to those who in their testimony classified as members of the infernal plot to &#8220;cut the throats of every Spaniard, without regard even to parentage&#8221;, the names <pb id="pb192" n="192"/>of some of the most prominent <corr sic="filipinos">Filipinos</corr> of to-day, men who although they have not grovelled in the dust before the <corr sic="conquerer">conqueror</corr> and accepted positions under the new Government, are more truly prominent than those who assert themselves as the &#8220;leaders&#8221; of the people.
</p><p>Among these honorable exceptions there were many who although they came to form part of the so-called Revolutionary Government, did so only when Spanish rule had ceased to exist, and when the accepted opinion was that a government elected by the people would be recognized by the U. S. These, however, were never traitors to the mother country; they were men who treated Spain as every honorable man should treat his country. These were not men who changed their religion as they changed their clothes: to suit the occasion. They were not men who concealed their titles to freemason degrees, at the bottom of their trunks, and exposed them with pride upon the change of sovereignty. These men were never perjurers, never traitors. Born and raised in the bosom of the Catholic faith they remained faithful to it, and faithful to the traditions of the country which gave <pb id="pb193" n="193"/>them their political being; and it is with great pleasure that, with Sr. Diaz, I also can say, that I have great pleasure in recognizing these honorable exceptions, and in proof thereof have I dedicated this small historical sketch to them.

</p><p>&#8220;In the month of October 1893, the Superior Council becoming aware that some documents pertaining, to the <hi lang="es" xml:lang="es">Liga</hi> had been handed over to the offices of the General Government, the dissolution of the society <pb id="pb194" n="194"/>was determined.&#8221;&#8212;Testimony of Domingo Franco y Tuason.

</p><p>On the 25th of May 1896, notice was given by the secret police to Governor General Blanco, as follows:
</p><p>&#8220;Notice is herewith given of the existence in Manila, of a Society named <hi lang="es" xml:lang="es">La Liga Filipina</hi>, to which are affiliated a large number of individuals....&#8221;


</p><p id="n63"><hi rend="sc">Note 63.</hi> The testimony given by many of the political prisoners as to the foundation, aims and work of the <hi>Compromisarios</hi> is somewhat conflicting. For instance: Antonio Salazar, (fols. <corr sic="1.008">1,008</corr>&#8211;<corr sic="1.013">1,013</corr>) testified that on account of the mal-administration of the funds, &#8220;the subscription on behalf of <hi>La Propaganda</hi> ceased, and under the name of <hi>Compromisarios</hi> was founded an association <corr sic="compossed">composed</corr> of ... (here follow names of members), and seeing that they could not gather sufficient funds, they agreed to increase the subscription and seek persons to associate with them.&#8221;
</p><p>On another occasion the same witness testified (fols. <corr sic="1.014">1,014</corr>&#8211;<corr sic="1.018">1,018</corr>) that certain persons whom he named were the &#8220;<hi lang="es" xml:lang="es">Compromisarios</hi>, who were in communion with Marcelo <pb id="pb195" n="195"/>(del Pilar), and who remitted money to him.&#8221; He also stated that &#8220;on account of the bad conduct observed in Madrid by Pilar, ... some of the <hi lang="es" xml:lang="es">Compromisarios</hi> refused to send him resources.&#8221;
</p><p>In reply to a question as to the relationship between the <hi lang="es" xml:lang="es">Compromisarios</hi> and the <hi>Katipunan</hi>, he gave as his opinion, that &#8220;there could be no doubt that both societies aimed at the same end.&#8221; At fols. 1118&#8211;1129 the same witness affirmed that &#8220;as the partisans of Rizal and Pilar ... saw that neither masonry nor the <hi>Liga</hi> could hope for funds<note n="a">There were always plenty of funds, but the money too often stuck to the fingers of those who had the handling of it.</note>, they formed the society of <hi lang="es" xml:lang="es">Compromisarios</hi> among wealthy persons of Manila and the Provinces.<corr>&#8221;</corr>
</p><p>Domingo Franco affirmed that the outbreak of the revolt came as a great surprise to the <hi>Compromisarios</hi>.
</p><p>As to the aims of the society, Mois&#233;s Salvador y Francisco is authority for the statement that: <corr sic="&#8216;">&#8220;</corr>in one of the <hi>juntas</hi> they treated of the provision of arms and other material of war; and it was agreed, moreover, <pb id="pb196" n="196"/>to gather funds for the said expenses, and as the <hi>junta</hi> replied that it was <corr sic="imposible">impossible</corr> at that time, a committee was appointed, composed of Jos&#233; Ramos, Doroteo Cort&#233;s and Ambrosio Rianzares Bautista, to draw up a petition for the aid of Japan.&#8221;
</p><p>Mois&#233;s also affirmed (fols. <corr sic="1.296">1,296</corr>&#8211;<corr sic="1.299">1,299</corr>) that the Supreme Council of the <hi>Compromisarios</hi> was formed as follows:

</p><p>Domingo Franco (fol. <corr sic="1.299">1,299</corr>&#8211;<corr sic="1.303">1,303</corr>) <corr sic="tetified">testified</corr> that upon the dissolution of the <hi>Liga</hi>, and in the month of October 1894, there gathered together in a house of the witness, Numeriano Adriano, Apolinario Mabini, Isidoro Francisco, Deodato Arellano and the witness, and it was decided to constitute the association known as the <hi lang="es" xml:lang="es"><corr sic="compromisarios">Compromisarios</corr></hi>, endeavouring to gather as many as forty members, each paying a monthly subscription <pb id="pb197" n="197"/>of 5 pesos, for the sustainment of the <hi lang="es" xml:lang="es">La Solidaridad</hi>.
</p><p>The same witness also testified (fols<corr>.</corr> <corr sic="1.332">1,332</corr>&#8211;<corr sic="1.337">1,337</corr>) that &#8220;The <hi>Liga</hi> and the <hi>Katipunan</hi> were constituted in three groups, viz<corr>.</corr>: the Supreme Council or the aristocracy, under the presidency of Francisco L. <corr sic="Rojas">Roxas</corr>; the <hi lang="es" xml:lang="es">Compromisarios</hi> or middle classes, divided into <hi>juntas</hi> or local councils.... The third <corr sic="aggroupation">aggregation</corr> was the <hi>Katipunan</hi> under the presidency of Andr&#233;s Bonifacio, and was composed of the lower classes.
</p><p>From all this we gather that the association of <hi lang="es" xml:lang="es">Compromisarios</hi> was founded with the idea of collecting funds to continue the work commenced by masonry and the <hi>Liga</hi>. The association was, practically, a committee formed to take up the work of the <hi>Liga</hi>, but formed in such a manner as to avoid suspicion, and all compromise with the late <hi>Liga</hi>. In its formation, its duties and its methods, it differed from both the <hi>Liga</hi> and from the <hi>Katipunan</hi>, but whilst differing from them it formed a tie between them, <corr sic="carring">carrying</corr> on a work which the <hi>Katipunan</hi> could not carry on of itself. The <hi>Liga</hi> died; and its <corr sic="mantel">mantle</corr> fell upon the <hi>Compromisarios</hi>. This society inspired, <pb id="pb198" n="198"/>watched over and protected the labor of its successor, the <hi>Katipunan</hi>, the fighting machine of the separatist or filibuster element.


</p><p id="n64"><hi rend="sc">Note 64.</hi> The idea which appeared to pervade the minds of the so-called progressive <corr sic="filipinos">Filipinos</corr> was that with a code of laws <hi>&#225; la Europea</hi>, the adoption of some or other new fangled idea imported from France, Germany or anywhere but the Peninsular, the <corr sic="filipino">Filipino</corr> would immediately attain the advancement and culture enjoyed among the Japanese. To anyone not acquainted with either the <corr sic="filipino">Filipino</corr> or the Japanese, such an idea might be acceptable; but no student of Oriental races, nor even the mere <corr sic="causual">casual</corr> observer of these two peoples, would venture to predict than even with all the advantages of modernism the <corr sic="filipino">Filipino</corr> now enjoys, will he, as a people, attain to such a state of culture as that enjoyed by the sons of the Empire of the Rising Sun even in a hundred years.
</p><p>Among the European peoples the progress of civilization and regeneration was slow but it was none the less decisive. Among Orientals it is, as a rule, quick but not lasting. Among almost all Oriental peoples <pb id="pb199" n="199"/>the rising generation is bright and gives signs of great possibilities; but these youths after having passed with honors through college and university, too often end their lives as they began them&#8212;as children. What the Oriental lacks is stability. Nothing is more common in the Philippines than to find that your cook or coachman has completed four-fifths of his studies as lawyer, doctor or something else. The <corr sic="filipino">Filipino</corr> who has reached the age of thirty and has not, in these days, been <hi lang="tl" xml:lang="tl">bata</hi><note n="a">A name given <corr sic="emong">among</corr> Spaniards, to young servant boys or girls. The word signifies servant and is used as such in the same manner as in British Oriental colonies the word <hi>boy</hi> is used,&#8212;irrespective of age.</note> in a convent or with a private family, been <hi>cochero</hi>, cook, collector of accounts for some business house, letter-carrier, postman, policeman, musician in a church choir, fireman, and connected with a few other employments of more or less importance, is by no means a <hi lang="la" xml:lang="la">rara avis</hi>, to say nothing of the many who have also been majors and generals in the insurgent &#8220;army&#8221;, and without stopping to consider a pair of very prominent natives who from <hi>batas</hi> in the University of Sto. Tom&#225;s <pb id="pb200" n="200"/>have, after a series of political intrigues, risen to positions of <hi>law-tinkers</hi> over a people, the vast majority of whom hate and despise them.
</p><p>As a matter of fact the very best of the filipino politicians and other local men of <hi>fame</hi>, bright, learned and progressive though they be, would count but little side by side with the foremost sons of the Flowery Kingdom. To find in Yokohama, or even in Nagasaki or Kobe, or any other city of Japan, a hundred Rizals, a hundred Pilars (Marcelos, Pios or Gregorios), a hundred Apacibles, or Mabinis, or Aguinaldos, or Buencaminos or Taveras would be an easy task. But to find in the Philippines a Marquis Ito, a Mutsu, a Yamata or a Matsugata,&#8212;that is the question.
</p><p>And why? Because at the time when Spain discovered these islands, finding the people in a state of social and moral degradation, without formal government or any social organization beyond the <corr sic="tribual">tribal</corr> system (and that but limited) common to almost all savage peoples, the Japanese had already counted with more than 1000 years of more or less stable government, always organized, and with a social organization <pb id="pb201" n="201"/>and a firm national unity. The people of Japan, at that time, cultivated the arts and sciences, enjoyed the fruits of prosperous industries and of external commerce. They had a religion and a language which could be written and understood when written. <corr sic="There">Three</corr> hundred years ago, when the <corr sic="filipinos">Filipinos</corr> were just commencing to learn the difference between man and beast, the <corr sic="Japanee">Japanese</corr> was enjoying a relative civilization not yet attained by the Chinese, much less by the <corr sic="partizans">partisans</corr> of the separatist leaders of Luzon and the Visayas.

Taking the whole question of the part played by Japan or by individual Japanese in the separatist movement from beginning to end I am strongly of the opinion that the supposed assistance, whether in the form of arms and ammunition, or in that of financial or moral support was a deliberate imposture, and that those credulous persons who contributed with their hard-earned money towards the sums said to have been utilized for propaganda in Japan, were defrauded, not only out of the money they gave to the funds, but also of what they might legitimately hope for as a result of the expenditure of the said funds.

</p><p>The person who, during the trials of those accused of treason, gave the most interesting testimony relative to this matter, was Juan Casta&#241;eda.

It was Ambrosio Flores who, at the opportune moment let fall the masonic sledge hammer upon the back of Pedro Serrano, charging him with being a traitor (see note <ref target="n12">12</ref>) to the cause.</note>.

That on their arrival at <corr sic="Yokahama">Yokohama</corr> they lodged at the house of Jos&#233; Ramos, where there also lived Artacho. &#8220;During the first days of their stay Ramos and Artacho seemed to look upon them with want of confidence, and hid from them their conversations.&#8221; He affirmed also that among the visitors to the house of Ramos were a Mr. Hirata, a professor of law, <corr sic="intermediatory">intermediary</corr> between Ramos <pb id="pb209" n="209"/>and Prince Konoy, resident in <corr sic="Tokio">Tokyo</corr>, and also, a Mr. Y&#243;sida, merchant.

</p><p>Isabelo de los Reyes<note n="a">I have frequently quoted the &#8220;Memoria&#8221; of Isabelo de los Reyes, because I consider that whilst in it he exaggerates and lies considerably, there are yet points upon which what he says has all the probability of the truth, in as much as when he finds it <corr sic="pay">pays</corr> to tell the truth he tells it. In this particular point, however, it is &#8220;<hi>according to what is said</hi>.&#8221;</note> says on this point:
</p><p>&#8220;According to what is said, Ramos interviewed, on several occasions, Prince Konoy, General Yamagata and the Count of Tokogana, who was then a minister. These gentlemen, it seems, were sympathizers <pb id="pb210" n="210"/>with the idea of our independence under the protectorate of Japan, as in <corr sic="Corea">Korea</corr>, and that they proposed, as a means of gaining it, the fomentation of Japanese immigration in the Philippines, and that when once this was attained, the seeking of a conflict with Spain.&#8221;
</p><p>Further on he states that: &#8220;Some days before the insurrection broke out, <corr sic="Is belo">Isabelo</corr> Artacho brought me a letter from Jos&#233; A. Ramos, in which he gave me an account of the efforts they were exerting to influence the leading politicians of Japan, to the end that they should aid us to secure our independence. Artacho told me verbally the details and that he knew that the liberal party of Japan, which then was the opposition, sympathized with the idea, and proposed as a means of attaining it, the seeking of a cause of conflict with Spain, introducing Japanese emigrants to that end.&#8221;
</p><p>Mois&#233;s Salvador (fols. <corr sic="1.138">1,138</corr>&#8211;<corr sic="1.143">1,143</corr>) stated that according to letters received by Bonifacio Ar&#233;valo from Cort&#233;s and Ramos, these two had been received by the Japanese minister of foreign affairs, to whom they expounded the object of their journey; and as the minister asked them what money they <pb id="pb211" n="211"/>had to cover the expenses of the enterprise, they replied that they would pay their way with <hi>the money they should seize, pertaining to the Religions Orders and to the Treasury</hi><note n="a">How much this reminds me of the story of the little boy who went to the grocer&#8217;s and asked for 10 cents worth of molasses. The shop-keeper measured out the molasses into the jug and asked the little boy for the dime, receiving the reply: &#8220;its at the bottom of the jug.&#8221; And that&#8217;s just where the other <corr sic="liitle">little</corr> boy&#8217;s money would have been.</note>; and being satisfied, the Japanese minister told them they might prepare themselves, for he would send them arms in June or July, to the coast of Luzon, to be disembarked near the island of Polillo....&#8221;
</p><p>That the separatists hoped for, and aimed to secure the aid of Japan is certain; many testified to the fact; but this testimony was more or less hearsay. Certain leading <corr sic="seperatists">separatists</corr> went to Japan to concoct the scheme and were, no doubt, listened to by some more or less prominent persons. This is all the more probable when we remember that the credentials carried by the Commission took the form of a petition signed by some 22,000 <corr sic="filipinos">Filipinos</corr>, that is, it bore that number of signatures.<note n="b">In the official extract of advice given by the <pb/>Secret Service to the Gov.

Gen. has received from the Emperor of that nation some messages which had been directed to him by some 22,000 <corr sic="filipinos">Filipinos</corr> in representation of the native inhabitants of these islands, and in the which, after congratulating him for his triumphs over the Chinese Empire, asks his protection and shelter for this Archipelago, and its annexation to the Japanese Empire.&#8221;</note>
<pb id="pb212" n="212"/></p><p>The work of propaganda carried on by certain <corr sic="filipinos">Filipinos</corr> cannot be called into question; but what is very uncertain is whether or not the Japanese extended the wished and hoped for assistance.

A father listens to the idle prattle of his child, but the childish words leave no other impression on his mind <corr sic="then">than</corr> their cuteness merits at the time. This is probably what occurred between Cortes and Ramos and the so-called &#8220;official&#8221; element of Japan.


</p><p id="n68"><hi rend="sc">Notes 68</hi> and <ab id="n69">69</ab>. Pio Valenzuela testified (fols. 582&#8211;605) that &#8220;in the month of May, a student of Law Daniel Aria y Tirona, came to his house and invited him to go to salute the commander of the Japanese <corr sic="cruizer">cruiser</corr> <pb id="pb213" n="213"/>the Kongo<note n="a">The word <hi>Kongo</hi> signifies <hi>Imperial diamond</hi>.</note>. That at an hour fixed, there gathered at the <hi>Bazar</hi><note n="b">The <hi>Bazar Japon&#233;s</hi> situated in Plaza Moraga.</note>, with the witness, Andr&#233;s Bonifacio, Emilio Jacinto, Jos&#233; Dizon and others, who were received by the commander of the cruiser with an air of <corr sic="indifferentism">indifference</corr>, and of apparent ridicule.... Bonifacio saluted and welcomed him to the islands, offering his services. The commander replied, thanking them and inviting them to take a voyage to Japan to visit the towns of that country, and enjoy its beautiful climate. Later on they directed a letter to the Commander, Jacinto drawing it up and Bonifacio, Dizon and himself and others signing it; its text was a salutation to the Emperor and Empress of Japan, and a manifestation of a desire to form a part of the said Empire, etc.... With the letter were presented twelve water-melons<note n="c">Typical of the heads of the twelve apostles of filibusterism.</note> sent by Emilio Aguinaldo, <hi lang="es" xml:lang="es">capitan municipal</hi> of Cavite Viejo, and a quantity of mangoes purchased by Cipriano Pacheco, and also a picture.&#8221;
</p><p>Jos&#233; Diz&#243;n Matanza questioned on the <pb id="pb214" n="214"/>same subject, affirmed (fols. <corr sic="1.132&#8211;1.138">1,132&#8211;1,138</corr>) that he was invited to the &#8220;Bazar Japon&#233;s,&#8221; to salute and welcome the commander of the cruiser (Kongo).... When he arrived they gave him iced water.... About an hour afterwards there arrived an officer of the ship who said he was the doctor, and soon after the commander arrived; all saluted him.... On the evening of the same day Bonifacio, Valenzuela and the witness went to Nagtajan to the house where lived the Japanese who kept the <hi>Bazar</hi>.... Bonifacio told them they had a letter to give them. Three or four days later on, Valenzuela presented himself at the house of the witness with a letter in Tagalo which read more or less as follows: (here follows what the witness remembered of the letter.) Bonifacio signed it as president of the Supreme Council of the <hi>Katipunan</hi>, Jacinto as secretary<corr sic=".">,</corr> Valenzuela as <hi>Fiscal</hi> and the witness with the name of Jos&#233; Talin.... After the departure of the Commander, the witness enquired of Bonifacio what result the letter had obtained, Andr&#233;s replying that the Commander had taken a copy of it, returning <pb id="pb215" n="215"/>the original, because the persons signing it were not representative; but that the said officer was very pleased with the pictures given in the name of the <hi>Katipunan</hi>, and with the melons and mangoes sent from Cavite.&#8221;
</p><p>Isabelo de los Reyes affirms that: &#8220;When the Japanese cruiser <hi>Kongo</hi> visited the port of Manila in May 1896, the Supreme Council of the <hi>Katipunan</hi> went to salute its commander in the upstairs of the <hi lang="es" xml:lang="es">Bazar Japon&#233;s</hi>, situated in the <hi lang="es" xml:lang="es">plaza</hi> del Padre Moraga, and handed him a manuscript setting forth their desire for the aid and assistance of Japan towards the gaining of independence for the Philippines. They also offered him a picture and some native fruits.&#8221;
</p><p>&#8220;The commander received them well and even regaled them with iced drinks and coffee, but did not dare to accept the document, limiting himself to the taking of a copy of it and promising to transmit their desires to the Emperor; he also invited them to make a voyage to his country. Nothing has since been heard of the commander.&#8221;
</p><p>So much for the testimony given concerning the <hi>Kongo</hi> and its commander.
</p><p>Information I have obtained from Japanese <pb id="pb216" n="216"/>semi-official sources on this point, shows that the <hi>Kongo</hi> steamed into Manila bay in 1896 in the same manner as it did recently, on a non-official visit. As was customary, the Japanese Commander and other officers visited the Japanese Bazaar in Plaza Moraga as well as other Japanese business houses. The <hi lang="es" xml:lang="es">Bazar <corr sic="Japones">Japon&#233;s</corr></hi> was a center to which friends and <corr sic="aquaintances">acquaintances</corr> gathered to salute the visiting officers. Upstairs were prepared iced drinks, etc. for those who cared to take them. Bonifacio and others, uninvited, walked in and presented themselves and their petition and offerings. The latter the commander accepted; the petition he did not accept: in this he showed good sense. As to the supposed copy which he promised to take, evidence goes to show that it was not taken, but that the said commander merely made a few notes of it on a scrap of paper. The proprietors of the <hi lang="es" xml:lang="es">Bazar</hi> ridicule the idea that the commander favored the petition or received the so-called commission with pleasure; their opinion is that to which any investigator of the affair would come, that the Commander was a gentleman and did not wish to hurt the feelings, by his refusal, of even such <hi lang="es" xml:lang="es">ignorantes</hi> as those who <pb id="pb217" n="217"/>at that time forced themselves upon him.


</p><p id="n70"><hi rend="sc">Note 70.</hi> The idea that the <hi>Liga</hi> was but an introduction to the <hi>Katipunan</hi> is not borne out by the facts of the case. The <hi>Liga Filipina</hi> was a foundation of Rizal, whilst the Katipunan was a conception of Pilar who, finding Rizal was carrying all before him, determined not to be <corr sic="outdone">out-done</corr> by his former companion. The very fact of the enmity existing between the two leaders is proof enough that the two societies were not one and the same thing, although after their foundation they walked arm in arm. The <hi>Liga</hi>, as an association, was eventually dissolved, and from <corr sic="it it">it</corr> was formed the <hi>Compromisarios</hi> (see note <ref target="n63">63</ref>) and this body continued its functions till the outbreak of the revolt. The vicissitudes of the <hi>Liga</hi> did not lessen Rizal&#8217;s influence. Ever ready to tell a lie or act one if it were to his own advantage, Rizal permitted the free use of his name in connection with the <hi>Katipunan</hi> also. To the vast majority of the <hi>oath-bound</hi>, the <hi>Katipunan</hi> was but the <hi>Liga</hi> under another form; and in order that the people should not know of the rivalry existing between himself and Pilar, Rizal <pb id="pb218" n="218"/>gave no signs of disfavor towards the foundation of the new society; in fact he rather favored it, seeing that under the circumstances it would make him figure as its &#8220;hero,&#8221; and he would thus be enabled to take the wind out of Pilar&#8217;s sails. The only objection raised by Rizal to the work of the <hi>Katipunan</hi>, was that which he made to Valenzuela: that the time had not yet come for armed rebellion.
</p><p>As long as he held supreme influence Rizal was satisfied; but as the <corr sic="seperatist">separatist</corr> element was becoming weary at the long absence of its &#8220;Moses&#8221; and had begun to worship the &#8220;calf&#8221; (not a golden one, by the way) &#8220;Moses&#8221; got angry and threw down, in disgust, the &#8220;tables of the law.&#8221;
</p><p>In its beginning, Rizal was the idol of the <hi>Katipunan</hi>, in the same way as Morayta (note <ref target="n13">13</ref>) was the idol of the rebellious <corr sic="filipinos">Filipinos</corr> in Madrid, and others parts of the Peninsular. Isabelo de los Reyes<note n="a">In his &#8220;Memoria&#8221;.</note> would have us believe that the foundation of the <hi>Katipunan</hi> was a result of the indignation of the people, consequent upon the deportation of Rizal. This, in the face <pb id="pb219" n="219"/>of facts, is a very poor argument and demonstrates either the ignorance or the bad faith of Reyes. And he himself contradicts it a few lines further on by saying &#8220;that without knowing Rizal, the <hi>Katipunan</hi> acclaimed him its honorary President.&#8221; This latter they certainly did but not &#8220;without knowing&#8221; him. They did<corr sic=","/> so because they knew nothing of his disagreement with Pilar, the real founder of their society, and because the aim of the two societies was practically one.


</p><p id="n71"><hi rend="sc">Note 71.</hi> The similarity of character between the <hi>Liga</hi> and the <hi>Katipunan</hi> has always been a matter of discussion. Some writers would draw a hard and fast line between the two, considering them as oil and water, two bodies enemies one of the other; others looking upon them as two oils, the one vegetable and the other mineral which, although differing in nature, mix together thoroughly.
</p><p>Reyes, in his oft-quoted &#8220;Memoria&#8221; to the then Gov. General, Primo de Rivera, in a mad attempt to prove that the insurrection was owing to the &#8220;friars&#8221; and that they attempted to invent the <hi>Katipunan</hi> plot to cover up their treason, says:
<pb id="pb220" n="220"/></p><p>&#8220;Above all, the friars committed the criminal and suicidal infamy of calumniously including in the <hi>Katipunan</hi> the <corr sic="millonaire">millionaire</corr> and aristocratic element, and the middle classes, the fact being that they had nothing in common with the <corr sic="plebian">plebeian</corr> association which they not only despised for its low condition, but which the few who knew of its existence must have hated, if not for egotism, for the socialistic <corr sic="tendancies">tendencies</corr> of the said group.&#8221;
</p><p>Such assertions <corr sic="searcely">scarcely</corr> deserve comment, for from beginning to end, the proceedings against the separatists were in the hands of the civil authorities, the members of the Religious Orders having no influence whatever in the matter, although it was they who, by their watchfulness over the interests of the country had detected symptoms which they, as true patriots, made known to the civil authorities. True it is also that a friar, Padre Mariano Gil, made known, at a critical moment, the plot of the diabolical society, in time to prevent the bloodthirsty fiends rising in a night and cutting the throats of those who had been their benefactors; but the &#8220;friar&#8221; was never a secret service agent of the Government. <pb id="pb221" n="221"/>What he did was what every patriotic Spaniard would have done under the circumstances. It was the civil authorities who, upon the discovery of the plot, caused the arrest of those complicated, and who tried and passed judgement upon the guilty. If millionaires and others were counted among the members of the <hi>Katipunan</hi> it was because they were guilty of the same treason as the <hi>katipuneros</hi> and not because they were &#8220;included&#8221; by the &#8220;friar&#8221;.

</p><p>So says Isabelo de los Reyes, the founder of the late <corr sic="filipino">Filipino</corr> Democratic Party, and the Workman&#8217;s Democratic Union, the most socialist movement in the history of the Philippines. So much for the <hi>Liberty</hi>, <hi>Equality</hi> and <hi>Fraternity</hi> which they all professed.
</p><p>Another writer, C. de Valdez, a <foreign lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">nom-de-plume</foreign> under which I recognize as hidden one whose knowledge on this subject was very extensive, who for the study of the <pb id="pb222" n="222"/>question had at his disposition innumerable documents of vital importance, gives as his opinion: &#8220;It has been said that the <hi>Liga</hi> was a society into the which there entered only elements of a certain culture, and the people of money; whilst the <hi>Katipunan</hi> was formed for the poor and laboring classes. If by this it <corr sic="it">is</corr> <corr sic="intented">intended</corr> to signify that they were two close societies, the one which should comprehend what we might call the aristocracy and the other the common people, we cannot agree with the opinion, because it is in contradiction with the facts. There existed a free communication between both societies and the prominent personages of the <hi>Liga</hi> mixed with the humble ones of the <hi>Katipunan</hi>, taking active part in the labors and forming part of the reunions and assemblies<note n="a">I am inclined to differ somewhat with this opinion. What is more probable is that as regards the actual membership there existed a gulf between the wealthy and the lower classes which was bridged by the representatives of either association. I have not come across any concrete evidence that the two elements really mixed, the one with the other; the inborn pride of the <corr sic="chinese">Chinese</corr> half caste, the class from which, the majority of the wealthy <corr sic="element">elements</corr> came, and of the <hi lang="es" xml:lang="es">indio</hi> of money or political &#8220;pull&#8221;, would not permit such a mixture of the two associations Se&#241;or Vald&#233;s supposes.</note>; <pb id="pb223" n="223"/>in the same way the individuals of common class entered the files of the <hi>Liga</hi> without any distinction of class being drawn between them.&#8221;
</p><p>The writer goes on to show that the three main things needed for the Revolution were 1st: an active propaganda of <corr sic="seperatist">separatist</corr> ideas; 2nd: funds to cover expenses and to purchase arms, and 3rd: a considerable number of persons ready to take up arms in the field. The first two of these main things were to be attended to by the <hi>Liga</hi> and the third by the <hi>Katipunan</hi>.
</p><p>&#8220;In the greatest utility in attaining the ultimate end of the initiators and directors of the conspiracy, must <corr sic="he">be</corr> <corr sic="saught">sought</corr> the distinction between the <hi>Liga</hi> and the <hi>Katipunan</hi>, and the difference which the one or the other society enjoyed.&#8221;
</p><p>&#8220;In all other things, both societies, or both <corr sic="organisims">organisms</corr> of the same society, co-exist, and display their activity jointly, the campaign of the <hi>Katipunan</hi> or that of the <hi>Liga</hi> being the most active; according as the necessities with which the one or the other were preferentially encharged to satisfy the final triumph of the revolt, might be of the greatest urgency or immediate utility.&#8221;
<pb id="pb224" n="224"/></p><p>The fact is that the <hi>Liga</hi> and the <hi>Katipunan</hi> were the distinct foundations of two personal enemies, both of whom wished to hold for himself the position of supreme chief of the movement. (See note <ref target="n70">70</ref>).
</p><p>D. Manuel Luengo, Civil Governor of Manila, in a report to the Minister of Foreign affairs, speaking on the subject of the Katipunan, says:
</p><p>&#8220;To carry to a head their fearful and criminal idea, they found it necessary to recruit many people of all classes and from all the provinces, seeking a useful means to facilitate the conjuration. And the indian being by reason of his ignorance and his <sic>barbarianism</sic>, like all peoples of his kind, easily fanaticised, they set to work to fanaticise the masses, these hordes of childish people, these ignorant laborers; and they fanaticised them by means of the <hi lang="es" xml:lang="es">pacto-de-sangre</hi>, making them swear war to the death to Spaniards, practicing an incision in the left arm, and with the blood which flowed from the wound made them sign their frightful oath.&#8221;

</p><p id="n72"><hi rend="sc">Note 72.</hi> Deodato Arellano, Bonifacio, Dina and Plata, it will be remembered, were energetic workers of the <hi>Liga</hi>. They had entered into the scheme of Rizal&#8217;s association before Pilar&#8217;s idea of a similar society had become known. Two months or so after the foundation of the <hi>Liga</hi>, at the time when its founder was deported to Dapitan, it was decided to take up Pilar&#8217;s project and see what could be done towards carrying it to a successful issue.
</p><p>Jos&#233; Dizon y Matanza (<corr sic="fol.">fols.</corr> 1,129&#8211;<corr sic="1.131">1,131</corr>) testified that &#8220;on the same day in which General Despujols ordered the publication in the <hi lang="es" xml:lang="es">Gaceta</hi> of the deportation of Rizal, there gathered in a house in calle Ilaya, Bonifacio, Arellano, Valentin Diaz, Teodoro Plata, Dina and the witness; and they agreed to form a society to be known as the <hi>Katipunan</hi>, the object and ends of which were to be filibusterism, or, in other words, the <pb id="pb226" n="226"/>liberty of the country from Spanish rule; the six persons present immediately proceeded to perform upon themselves the incision of the <hi lang="es" xml:lang="es">pacto-de-sangre</hi>, signing with their own blood a blank paper, placing after the signature, the symbolic name each chose for himself. They then drew up the <corr sic="programe">programme</corr> of the Society. This <corr sic="programe">programme</corr> was composed of 6 articles, viz<corr>.</corr>: 1st: to constitute a secret society known as the <hi>Katipunan</hi>; 2nd: that the organization was to be by triangles, to the end that no more than three members should know one another; 3rd: that the initiated should pay <hi>one real</hi> entrance fee, and a <hi>half real</hi> as a monthly subscription; 4th: that as the number of the members increased they should found one or more <hi lang="tl" xml:lang="tl">balang&#771;ay</hi> in each district; 5th: to try to gather funds to carry out the purposes of the society; 6th: that when the opportunity occurred they should reform these articles.
</p><p>They also agreed upon the form of oath which should be taken by the initiated, which was to promise to shed even the last drop of blood for the liberty of the Philippines.<corr sic="&#187;"/>
</p><p>The Katipunan was founded upon masonic usage adapted to the character of the association. <pb id="pb227" n="227"/>Its formation was one of triangles, each new <hi>Katipunero</hi> being bound to attract to the association, two others to occupy the opposite angles. This formation was eventually changed on account of the extent to which the society extended, <corr sic="it">its</corr> management becoming very difficult. The particular triangles were broken up and the association formed in three degrees. The first degree was composed of the recently initiated members. These each possessed a mask and some form of arm, either fire-arm or bolo, the cost of which was borne by the member possessing it. The members who enjoyed the second degree also possessed masks and wore as a regalia a ribbon to which was attached a medal bearing a letter (equivalent to K) of the old-time form of script of the pre-Spanish filipino; also a sword and <corr sic="bannar">banner</corr> crossed.
</p><p>The third degree members possessed red masks, the color being distinctive of the degree, in the same way as the color of the second degree was green, and that of first, black. These colors were symbolic: green signified hope, and red, war. Black was but a general color common to bandits all the world over. The masks of the third degree <pb id="pb228" n="228"/>bore a triangle with three K&#8217;s in the upper part, in the ancient <corr sic="filipino">Filipino</corr> script, and at the base the letters Z&#8756; Ll&#8756; B&#8756; (see at commencement of book). The inferior inscription signified &#8220;sons of the people.&#8221;
</p><p>Each degree had its pass words and the members only knew those of their own degree.
</p><p>This was the latter form of the <hi>Katipunan</hi> in which it differed somewhat from the <hi>Liga</hi>.
</p><p>Pilar&#8217;s plan was <corr sic="revolutionanary">revolutionary</corr>; Bonifacio&#8217;s truly anarchistic.
</p><p>Among the &#8220;chosen people&#8221; who testified before the Schurman Commission were two of the three native members of the present U. S. Commission, Tavera and Legarda. Both of these, among many other statements which will not hold water, had something to say on the subject of the <hi>Katipunan</hi>.
</p><p>Legarda stated that: (see Report of the Philippine Commission, 1900; vol. II page 377.<corr>)</corr>
</p><p>&#8220;This Society of <corr sic="filipinos">Filipinos</corr> (the separatist element) united itself to the masonic society in Spain, and they established branches here; and this masonic society which was a true masonic society with all the characteristics <pb id="pb229" n="229"/>of Masonry, converted itself afterwards into the <hi>Katipunan</hi> society. This society, the <hi>Katipunan</hi>, made great progress here in the Philippines, for they had to <corr sic="do do">do</corr> greatly with the common people; they never had anything to do, or mixed at at all, with the higher class of people here in the Philippines<note n="a">See note <ref target="n56">56</ref>; also foot-note, page 180.</note>. As a result of this the society gained much credit and power, and undermined the forces which were in existence, especially the native regiments of Tagalogs. This was in 1896; the Revolution broke out at San Juan del Monte in August. A curious fact that must be noted was that a friar, who was the priest of Tondo, was the cause of its breaking out; for Gen. Blanco knew of this movement of the people and what was going on<note n="b">The witness might have added that Blanco as a <hi>mason</hi> did more than &#8220;know&#8221; of it: he took no steps to counter-act it, till circumstances demanded that harsh measures should be taken to maintain national honor.</note>, and was in favor of making concessions to the people. This friar denounced the society, for he had a very intimate friend <pb id="pb230" n="230"/>who was a filipino, and he caused this friend to be introduced into the <hi>Katipunan</hi> society<note n="a">In plain English, this is a <hi>lie</hi> and no one could know it better than the witness.</note>, and this friend afterwards became the leader of the revolution himself. This <corr sic="filipino">Filipino</corr> was named Andr&#233;s Bonifacio, and later on he was chief of the revolution and chief of the <hi>Katipunan</hi> society. He took refuge in Cavite, and all that province rose up. Aguinaldo who was Municipal Captain in Cavite Viejo that time, was also a member of the <hi>Katipunan</hi>. When he heard that the <corr sic="civil">Civil</corr> Guard was going to arrest him, he revolted too. He met a man who was his superior in the society&#8212;that is, Bonifacio&#8212;and as his ambition was his moving spirit, he caused Bonifacio to be shot.&#8221;
</p><p>Tavera gave his opinion as follows: (see same Report, page 399. Vol II).
</p><p>&#8220;The conviction was strong among the Filipinos that they would not succeed in attaining anything by any other means than force. This being the case, the idea occurred to some <corr sic="filipinos">Filipinos</corr> to found a system of <corr sic="masony">masonry</corr> here. There were some lodges of the masonic order here, and the idea presented <pb id="pb231" n="231"/>itself to form a sort of political masonry, which was created and called the <hi>Katipunan</hi>. This Katipunan society was naturally a secret society and had, I think, about 400,000 members, principally in the Tagalog provinces and of the people of the valley of the Pasig River. I think in Manila and in the valley of the Pasig there were 80,000, naturally, as there were so many, and as they were so strong, the idea of a revolution was a natural consequence. The principal agitator of all this movement was a man named Andr&#233;s Bonifacio, who stirred up and directed it. The political movement in the Philippines was started, as was natural, by the aristocracy of wealth and of intelligence, but the <hi>Katipunan</hi> society was formed entirely of the elements from the lowest class of society. Bonifacio was a man without education. He was employed in one of the business houses at a small salary, of perhaps $30 or $40 (<corr sic="mexican">Mexican</corr>) a month. They went on arranging their affairs very quietly and very secretly, awaiting a proper moment for action, which they believed would be the time of General Blanco&#8217;s departure from the Philippines. Gen. Blanco was a man who was well thought <pb id="pb232" n="232"/>of here<note n="a">By an element. Even would-be-president Bryan has his followers here.</note>, for he had a great deal of tolerance for the people<note n="b">In other words: he allowed a certain wealthy and influential class of <hi>people</hi> to lead him around wherever they would, by the nose<corr>.</corr></note>. He did tolerate masonry, and they believed that he also tolerated the existence of the Katipunan society. One day the priest of Tondo, Padre Gil, through the confession of a woman<note n="c">This statement is the result of either ignorance or malice. (See note <ref target="n97">97</ref>, <ref target="n98">98</ref><corr sic=":">.</corr>) This account also materially differs from the &#8220;faked up&#8221; story of Legarda. How little some people know of the truth when they do not wish to tell it!</note>, learned of the existence of the <hi>Katipunan</hi> society, for the woman&#8217;s husband was a member<note n="d">This is another. Now that Tavera and Legarda are side by side in the U. S. Commission they might compare their testimony with advantage: it might aid them to preserve somewhat of the truth in future.</note>. This Father Gil informed the General, so the <hi>Katipunan</hi> society was discovered.
</p><p>As the reader can easily see for himself there is considerable difference between the statements of these two persons; a comparison of these with the real facts of the case will <pb id="pb233" n="233"/>show how easy it is for a certain element to distort truth when it serves its purpose. I have quoted these two &#8220;chosen&#8221; people, not that their statements may go down to posterity as <hi>history</hi> (which has been distorted sufficiently), but because both Tavera and Legarda formed part of Aguinaldo&#8217;s mock government&#8212;the Filipino Commune; and therefore both of them had plenty of occasion to know the real facts of the case, facts they evidently desired, for some reason, to distort.

</p><p id="n74"><hi rend="sc">Note 74.</hi> Herein the <hi>katipuneros</hi> showed their madness. So fanaticised did they become that nothing of a nature or character Spanish was allowed to remain. They carried this anti-Espa&#241;olism to the utmost extreme<corr>.</corr> Those of the native clergy who sympathised with the <hi>Katipunan</hi> frequently tore down the images of the saints in the churches, merely because the said saints were Spanish or painted them black in order to work the easier upon the imagination of the people.
</p><p>It was this hatred for things Spanish that <pb id="pb234" n="234"/>gave rise to the bitterness demonstrated against the Religious Orders. The friar was a Spaniard, the most Spanish, as a general rule, of all the Spaniards in the Archipelago, and as such became the principal target.
</p><p>(See page 148).


</p><p id="n75"><hi rend="sc">Note 75.</hi> The revolution ever showed unmistakable signs of a bitter race hatred. When the revolt first broke forth this race hatred was confined to Spaniards; and it was not until the breaking out of the insurrection against the lawful authority of the U. S. that it became general. Till then anyone but a Spaniard could go from end to end of the Archipelago without molestation; but when the promises of independence and other things of a like nature, made by the American Consuls of <corr sic="Hong-kong">Hong-Kong</corr> and Singapore, and other irresponsible persons, failed to materialize, the self-asserted leaders of the people lost confidence in the white man and race hatred commenced to include all white people. When Aguinaldo&#8217;s hordes of <corr sic="semi savages">semi-savages</corr> commenced their attack upon the American forces, the effects of this race-hatred were <pb id="pb235" n="235"/>felt more than ever before in the history of the country. Not only was the white man to be destroyed, but all those who sympathised with him&#8212;the <corr sic="filipinos">Filipinos</corr> determined to &#8220;stagger humanity.&#8221; And how they were going to do it is demonstrated in a document signed by Aguinaldo, captured by the American forces and published by the War Department of the U. S. on the 5th of September 1900. The following are a few extracts from it<corr sic=";">:</corr>


    <q rend="block"><p>&#8220;Malolos, Jan. 9, 1899&#8212;Instructions to the Brave Soldiers of Sandtahan of Manila<corr>.</corr>

    </p><p>&#8220;Article 1. All Filipinos should observe our fellow-countrymen in order to see whether they are American sympathizers. They shall take care to work with them in order to inspire them with confidence of the strength of the holy cause of their country. Whenever they are assured of the loyalty of the converts they shall instruct them to continue in the character of an American sympathizer in order that they may receive good pay, but without prejudicing the cause of our country. In this way they can serve themselves, and at the same time serve the public by communicating to the committee of chiefs, and of our army, whatever news <pb id="pb236" n="236"/>of importance they may have<note n="a">It would be interesting to know just how many of the late insurgents who now hold position of importance under the Government, are following up this piece of advice of Aguinaldo.</note>.


    </p><p rend="class(h2)">Gifts as Covers for Attack.

    </p><p><corr sic="&#8216;">&#8220;</corr>Art. 2. All of the chiefs and Filipino brothers should be ready and courageous for the combat, and should take advantage of the opportunity to study well the situation of the American outposts and headquarters, observing especially secret places where they can approach and <corr sic="suprise">surprise</corr> the enemy.

    </p><p>&#8220;Art. 3. The chief of those who go to attack the barracks should send in first, four men with a good present for the American commander. Immediately after will follow four others, who will make a pretense of looking for the same officer for some reason and a larger group shall be concealed in the corners or houses in order to aid the other groups at the first signal. This wherever it is possible at the moment of attack.


    </p><p rend="class(h2)">To Murder in Woman&#8217;s Disguise.

    </p><p>&#8220;Art. 4. They should not, prior to the attack, look at the Americans in a threatening <pb id="pb237" n="237"/>manner. On the contrary, the attack on the barracks by the Sandtahan should be a complete surprise and with decision and courage. One should go alone in advance in order to kill the sentinel. In order to deceive the sentinel this one should dress as a woman, and must take great care that the sentinel is not able to discharge his piece, thus calling the attention of those in the barracks. This will enable his companions who are approaching to assist in the general attack.

    </p><p>&#8220;Art. 5. At the moment of the attack the Sandtahan should not attempt to secure rifles from their dead enemies, but shall pursue, slashing right and left with bolos until the Americans surrender, and after there remains no enemy who can injure, they may take the rifles in one hand and the ammunition in the other.


    </p><p rend="class(h2)"><corr sic="Firedrands">Firebrands</corr> from the Housetops

    </p><p>&#8220;Art. 6. The officers shall take care that on the top of the houses along the streets where the American forces shall pass there shall be placed four to six men, who shall be prepared with stones, timbers, red hot iron, heavy furniture, as well as boiling water, oil and molasses, rags soaked in coal-oil ready <pb id="pb238" n="238"/>to be <corr sic="lighed">lit</corr> and thrown down, and any other hard and heavy objects that they can throw on the passing American troops. At the same time in the lower parts of the houses will be concealed the Sandtahan, who will attack immediately.

    </p><p>&#8220;Great care should be taken not to throw glass in the streets, as the greater part of our soldiers go barefooted. On these houses there will, if possible, be arranged in addition to the objects to be thrown down, a number of the Sandtahan, in order to cover a retreat or to follow up a rout of the enemy&#8217;s column, so that we may be sure of the destruction of all the opposing forces.


    </p><p rend="class(h2)">Women to Prepare &#8220;Bombs&#8221;

    </p><p>&#8220;Art. 9. In addition to the instructions given in paragraph 6, there shall be in the houses vessels filled with boiling water, tallow, molasses and other liquids, which shall be thrown as bombs on the Americans who pass in front of their houses, or they can make use of syringes or tubes of bamboo. In these houses shall be the Sandtahan, who shall hurl the liquids that shall be passed to them by women and children.

    </p><p><corr>&#8220;</corr>Art. 10. In place of bolos or daggers if <pb id="pb239" n="239"/>they do not possess the same, the Sandtahan can provide themselves with lances and arrows with long sharp heads, and these should be shot with great force in order that they may penetrate well into the bodies of the enemy. And they should be so made that in withdrawal from the body the head will remain in the flesh.

</p><p>This race hatred is illustrated very clearly in the definition of the Katipunan given by Romualdo Teodoro de J., when he said that its aim was to <hi>kill all Spaniards</hi> and take possession of the islands. No particular hatred was shown to any class; it was all Spaniards of all <corr sic="clases">classes</corr> and conditions who <pb id="pb241" n="241"/>were to be assassinated. It is also clearly depicted in the Act of Session of the <hi>Katipunan Sur</hi> already quoted (See page 81; also foot-note page 80).

</p><p>Numeriano Adriano testified (fols. <corr sic="1.309">1,309</corr>&#8211;<corr sic="1.312">1,312</corr>) that Andr&#233;s Bonifacio had collected 10,000 pesos for the purchase, in Japan, of 4,000 rifles with abundant ammunition.<corr sic="&#8221;"/>
</p><p>He also stated that the arms had been purchased and were to be landed near by the mountains of San Mateo and in the Batanes islands, from whence they would be brought to Manila.
</p><p>That &#8220;Andr&#233;s Bonifacio went to San Mateo with men to receive and arrange arms, whilst Deodato Arellano and Timoteo Paez were encharged to send people to Batanes to the same end.&#8221;
</p><p>Also that &#8220;It is said that many of the insurgents in the province of Cavite bear arms of different systems, and he supposed that they must have been acquired by the rich and wealthy persons of that province, such as Francisco Osario and others, who knowing perhaps of the existence of the <hi>Liga</hi> of Manila, its form and object, had formed their own also, in the said province, in <pb id="pb244" n="244"/>order to unite to that of Manila and make common cause therewith.&#8221;
</p><p>Domingo Franco declared (fols. <corr sic="1.381">1,381</corr>&#8211;<corr sic="1.382">1,382</corr>), in answer to a question during his trial, as to what he knew in reference to the purchase of arms and <corr sic="ammuntion">ammunition</corr>, that &#8220;all he knew was that arms and ammunition had been purchased, because at the end of 1895, or the beginning of 1896, he saw Francisco L. Rojas in his office in Calle Jolo, and the said Rojas told him that he had received a quantity of arms and ammunition.&#8221; He stated moreover, that he did not know the make or number, nor where they had been landed.
</p><p>Tomas Prieto of Nueva Caceres mentioned the receipt of 50 arms from Bato. He also stated that Mariano Melgarejo, according to references from Macario Valentin, received a load of arms in eleven cases from Pasacao.&#8221;
</p><p>Pio Valenzuela affirmed that the arms borne by the rebels were for the most part domestic bolos<note n="a">Domestic: i. e., made for household use, for cutting up meat, <corr sic="cuting">cutting</corr> down bamboos, and in fact for every use for which a knife or chopper is needed.</note> and lances, and <pb id="pb245" n="245"/>that the chiefs were armed with revolvers.&#8221; These revolvers were, he affirmed, acquired from the <hi lang="es" xml:lang="es">Maestranzi de Artilleria</hi>.
</p><p>Juan Casta&#241;eda declared that &#8220;the Japanese offered to land here 100,000 rifles with their ammunition, the <corr sic="expence">expense</corr> of which should be paid in a fixed number of years.&#8221;
</p><p>Numeriano Adriano also affirmed that it had been decided to purchase arms in Japan and that <corr sic="ne">one</corr> of the islands of the Archipelago should be given to Japan in exchange for its aid.
</p><p>Domingo Abella affirmed that he had visited Francisco Rojas in his office for the purpose of finding out if the arms which the tailor Luis Villareal had ordered for the society, had arrived; and that although Francisco Rojas did not belong to the society, he was encharged to <corr sic="proportion">portion out</corr> the arms and commissioned to bring them to Manila. Francisco told him that he could not provide him with any as they were all sold.
</p><p>The <corr sic="nett">net</corr> cost of the arms and ammunition necessary to carry out the revolt was considerable, and as their introduction into the country would have to be very carefully <corr sic="planed">planned</corr>, and be carried out with the <pb id="pb246" n="246"/>greatest secrecy, the original cost would <corr sic="be be">be</corr> considerably increased. Large sums of money were therefore necessary to cover expenses. Although the entrance fees and monthly subscriptions were considerable they could not produce the amount necessary to provide for the revolution, especially when there existed such a wide spread <corr sic="tendancy">tendency</corr> among those who handled the funds, to <corr sic="absorbe">absorb</corr> them as a sponge <corr sic="absorbes">absorbs</corr> water. Castillo in his work concerning this association and its funds says<note n="a">Castillo y Jimenez; <hi lang="es" xml:lang="es">El Katipunan &#243; el filibusterismo en Filipinas</hi>: pp. 128&#8211;129.</note>:
</p><p>&#8220;Undoubtedly it (the Katipunan) <corr sic="possesed">possessed</corr> large sums of money, only the most insignificant part of which, according to report, was discovered in the possession of Pio Valenzuela, preserved in gold and amounting, we believe, to less than 30,000 pesos. These resources could not cover the extraordinary expenses of the propaganda, that of the Commissioners sent to Japan to treat with that power on the question of a protectorate, and that of the coming war<corr sic=","/> expenses which were without doubt, very considerable.
</p><p>&#8220;The <corr sic="indian">Indian</corr> is not so selfish or so patriotic <pb id="pb247" n="247"/>that he would, without immediate advantage to himself permit himself the extravagance of abandoning the <corr sic="sedentery">sedentary</corr> life he usually leads, to launch out into the field of adventures of doubtful result. Those who from the headquarters of the revolution directed those torpid masses must have realised this, and to make sure of the exit, caused money to be distributed to all the affiliated and to their families, giving them at the same time rice in abundance.
</p><p>&#8220;On the morning of the events which took place at San Juan del Monte, two women who live in the Santa Mesa road, were engaged in giving money to the <hi>taos</hi><note n="a">That is men of the lower classes, laborers.</note> who passed that way, advising them to unite themselves with the <hi lang="es" xml:lang="es">insurrectos</hi> to the end of killing all the Spaniards....
<milestone rend="dots" unit="tb"/>
</p><p>&#8220;This money set aside for distribution in San Juan del Monte, in Pasig and in the pueblos on the banks of the river, must have come from a well stocked treasury....&#8221;
<milestone rend="dots" unit="tb"/>
</p><p>A little further on, the author gives a very broad hint as to one probable source of funds when he asks the question, where <pb id="pb248" n="248"/>is the <hi>million and a half pesos</hi> which constitute the default in the public treasury of Manila?
</p><p>&#8220;It would be a curious coincidence,&#8221; says the author, &#8220;if part of this amount perhaps the greater part should have served as funds from which the expenses of the revolution and the war were paid.&#8221;


</p><p id="n78"><hi rend="sc">Note 78.</hi> The initiations into the <hi>Katipunan</hi> were grotesque in the extreme. The person introduced for initiation was placed in a room draped in black, with its walls hung with mottoes in Tagalog dialect such as: &#8220;If you have courage you may continue,&#8221; &#8220;If you have been brought here by your curiosity, retire.&#8221; Upon a table was placed a skull, a loaded revolver and a bolo. A paper upon which were written three questions lay also upon the table. These questions were<corr sic=";">:</corr> &#8220;In what state did the Spaniards find the Tagalog people at the time of the conquest? In what state are they found now? What future can it hope for?
</p><p>The initiated previously instructed by his god-father, or by the person who catechised him, was to reply that, at the time of the arrival of the Spaniards, the <corr sic="filipinos">Filipinos</corr> <pb id="pb249" n="249"/>living on the coasts enjoyed a certain amount of civilization, since they already had cannons and silk dresses, that they enjoyed political liberty, sustained diplomatic (sic) relations and commerce with the neighboring countries of Asia; had their own religion and writing; in a word, lived happy with their independence. A <hi>certain amount</hi> of civilization may be. Let us see what that <hi>certain amount</hi> was:
</p><p>&#8220;Barely clothed, and more often naked, revelling day and night in <corr sic="drunkeness">drunkenness</corr>, given to the practice of infanticide, holding virginity as a dishonor, having among them people who practiced defloration as a profession, ignorant of the value and uses of money, making use of men, women and children to pay debts, in <corr sic="continal">continual</corr> warfare with one another and enslaving their prisoners, practicing wholesale murder of slaves on the death of a chief or important personage, adoring and sacrificing to rocks, trees, crocodiles and idols of wood; lacking religion, but having in its stead most <corr sic="beastial">bestial</corr> and absurd superstitions; without temples, monuments or even literature, although they possessed a species of written language. The only human ideas they possessed were adopted <pb id="pb250" n="250"/>from the Chinese, Japanese and Borneo <corr sic="mahomedans">Mohammedans</corr> whom they imitated after the manner of apes. This, historians tell us, was the condition of this people 340 years ago! when the missionaries planted the Cross on Philippine soil, and brought to the benighted natives the gospel.&#8221; So much for the certain amount of civilization.
</p><p><hi>Cannons and silk dresses</hi>: of a kind; as to the cannons, where did they all come from? Bought from or exchanged with the Borneo moros probably. As to these and the silk dresses, the savages of the south-sea islands enjoyed the use of such things and enjoyed them with better knowledge of how to use them! They enjoyed <hi>political liberty</hi>; let us see what Morga the historian who speaks most glowingly of the ancient civilization of the <corr sic="filipino">Filipino</corr> peoples, has to say on this point.
</p><p>He says: &#8220;In all these islands the people had neither kings <corr sic="or">nor</corr> lords to dominate them as in other kingdoms and provinces. But in each island were many chiefs from among the same natives, some greater than others each one with his subjects, by groups and families, who obeyed and respected them. Sometimes these chiefs were at peace with <pb id="pb251" n="251"/>one another and some times at war.... The superiority which these <corr sic="chief">chiefs</corr> had over the people of their group was such that they held them as subjects, <hi>with power to treat them well or ill, disposing of their persons, children and estates at their will, without <corr sic="resistence">resistance</corr> or the necessity of giving account to anyone, and for very slight offences they killed and wounded them and made slaves of them<corr sic=".">;</corr></hi> and if it happened that one of the chiefs were bathing in the river and a native passed in front of him or looked upon him with want of respect, and for other similar things, they <hi>made slaves of them for ever</hi>.&#8221; This is a good and practical kind of political liberty, just the kind of liberty the country would enjoy if in the hands of the leaders of the Federal Party, so anxious for liberties for themselves and coercion for those who do not agree with their way of thinking.
</p><p><hi>Diplomatic relations and commerce with the neighboring countries of Asia</hi>: As to the diplomatic relations the mere idea of such a thing is <corr sic="perposterous">preposterous</corr>. If we are to concede the use of diplomatic relations to the ancient Tagalog people, then we must consider as diplomatic relations such customs <pb id="pb252" n="252"/>as the passing of the &#8220;peace pipe&#8221; practiced by the indian of the United States, and the giving and accepting of young women for sensual convenience practiced in many of the islands of the Pacific up to the present day. As to their foreign commerce let us listen once more to Morga. &#8220;Their contracts and negotiations were as a rule illicit, each one considering the best way to come off successful in his business.&#8221;
</p><p><hi>Their own <corr sic="religon">religion</corr></hi>: For a religious system they worshiped their ancestors and performed human sacrifices. The Spaniards found in these islands less than a million inhabitants, who were divided into innumerable tribes governed by rulers who had no more title of sovereignty than that they were enabled to impose upon the people by brute force and untold cruelties. The inhabitants formed a jumble of inferior races some more or less pure in blood, others intermixed; people speaking many dialects. They all lacked religion, in the proper sense of the word; they lacked morals, in fact they were wanting in everything that raises man above the level of the brute creation.
</p><p>As to their own writing, certain it is that they possessed a crude and very inefficient <pb id="pb253" n="253"/>manner of writing, but what is very remarkable is, that in spite of their possessing a system of script, not a single piece of their literary work has yet been discovered nor even a written tradition. This goes to prove that either the <corr sic="filipinos">Filipinos</corr> were at that time too deep in the savage ages to realise the importance of writing, or that the form of script was useless for practical purposes.
</p><p>To the second question the initiated replied that the friar missionaries had done nothing to civilize the <corr sic="filipinos">Filipinos</corr>, as they considered the civilization and illustration of the country to be incompatible with their interests<note n="b"><p>It is difficult to determine whether such statements are due to ignorance or to malice. The real truth of the situation is that although the friar came <corr sic="te">to</corr> the Philippines to perform sacerdotal duties and preach the Gospel, his beneficial influence was not confined to the mere preaching of the Gospel. &#8220;What most honors the whole membership past and present of the Religious Orders is the intense zeal shown in the temporal as well as the spiritual welfare of their <corr sic="parishoners">parishioners</corr>. To merely defeat and drive out the bad that was in them was not sufficient, for Satan finds mischief for idle hands, and when one devil is driven out of a man he roams around seeking other devils with whom he returns and re-enters the soul and &#8220;the last state of that man becomes worse than the first.&#8221; So to thoroughly carry out their christianizing <pb/>and civilizing purpose they did their best to instruct their converts to occupy their time in the fields, in the building of houses, of churches, of structures of all kinds necessary. They taught them to be self-supporting and to build up happy homes around them<corr sic=",">.</corr> The few industries, if the little then done by the natives in the way of manual labor can be classed as industry, that existed among the people at that time were copied from the Chinese and <corr sic="Mahomedan">Mohammedan</corr> traders who visited and traded with them. These industries however were but crude as a rule; and moreover the connection with these anti-christian influences had to be cut for the moral protection of the indian and therefore the friar missionary, ever on the alert for his children&#8217;s welfare, instructed them in industries which, whilst occupying their time formerly spent in abject laziness, also gave them the advantage of money making.
</p><p>&#8220;As soon as the natives had become accustomed to<corr sic=";"/> living after the manner of civilized beings, the friars taught them the art of making lime, mortar and bricks and of utilizing these materials in buildings and fortifications for the common protection against their enemies. They instructed them in the method of tilling the virgin and fertile soil, of utilizing the many streams of <corr sic="warter">water</corr> that nature had provided.&#8221;
</p><p>And yet there are those who would make us believe that the friar missionary has done nothing to civilize the <corr sic="filipinos">Filipinos</corr>. To whom then do they owe the civilization they enjoy?</p></note>.
<pb id="pb254" n="254"/></p><p>To the third question the initiated was to reply that they had faith, courage and <pb id="pb255" n="255"/>constancy to aid them to remedy these evils in the future.<note n="a">Faith in their <hi>anting-anting</hi>; courage to maltreat and murder the helpless and sometimes dying prisoners that fell into their hands; and as to constancy...? The majority of the leaders eventually became traitors to the most cherished ideas of independence. Three figures alone stand out as really constant throughout the whole rebellion, and these three are Aguinaldo, Mabini, and Pio del Pilar; and of these three the most constant was Aguinaldo, a misguided man who deserves far more honor than those who deserted him and who never <corr sic="think">thought</corr> of raising a finger to alleviate his hard lot, a lot for which they are morally responsible.</note>
</p><p>The master of ceremonies warned him that he was taking a very important and very solemn step, and he was recommended to retire if he did not feel courage enough to continue since he would uselessly expose his life. If the initiated insisted in continuing with the mysteries of the initiation he was presented to the reunion of the brethren to be tried by the proofs assigned, which were very similar to those adopted in universal masonry, but surrounded with more paganism, if that be possible. He was blindfolded and made to discharge a revolver against an imaginary enemy, a person he was made to believe really was present and awaiting <pb id="pb256" n="256"/>there the executionary bullet which should make him pay the penalty of a treason. If he passed through the proofs successfully he was introduced into the hall of oaths and there with his own blood, drawn by means of an <corr sic="incission">incision</corr> made in the left arm between the shoulder and the elbow, he signed the oath.

</p><p id="n80"><hi rend="sc">Note 80.</hi> <hi>The liberty of the Tagalog people</hi>; the chief aim which gave rise to the revolt. The first thing the separatists desired was to get rid of the Peninsular Spaniard; the next to go would have been the insular Spaniard, then the Spanish mestizo, then the <corr sic="chinee">Chinee</corr> half-caste and the <corr sic="chinee">Chinee</corr>; after which would come the gradual extinction of the various tribes. In the mean time the country would suffer considerably and at last...? See page 69, last four lines of the first paragraph.
</p><p>It is well nigh impossible to imagine to what the liberty of the Tagalog people would mean if it were put into practice. If the South American states which are <pb id="pb257" n="257"/>recognized as independent, are unable to govern themselves in spite of the political superiority of the people inhabiting them over the peoples of this archipelago, without an unending series of revolutions, what <corr sic="night">might</corr> we expect from the Philippines? Give the country independence with one of the native &#8220;commissioners&#8221; as president of the republic and how long do you suppose it would be before Pedro Paterno at the head of some 5 or <corr sic="6.000">6,000</corr> men would march into Manila to depose the president and proclaim himself Emperor Pedro I? And before the new Emperor could install himself in Malaca&#241;an he would have at his heels a thousand and one petty chiefs, princes, kings and perhaps even a few ambitious queens!
</p><p>It is over a half a century ago since the South American Republics became independent, and at that time the rest of the world cared but little for the consequences of such a step. But this indifference of the nations can never exist here in the Orient at the <corr sic="commencenent">commencement</corr> of this XX Century<corr sic=",">.</corr> It would never suit the rest of the world to see independence declared in the Philippines and especially if that independence left the reins of government in the hands of the <hi>Tagalog</hi> people.
<pb id="pb258" n="258"/></p><p>The question of the expulsion from the country or the destruction of the Spaniards has been spoken of under several notes; the idea was, doubtless, a semi-savage interpretation of the preachings and teachings spread abroad by the Bible societies in all parts and especially in Spanish countries. And this becomes the more probable when we call to mind what the <hi lang="es" xml:lang="es">El Imparcial</hi> of the 26th of August 1896 published concerning this identical point. Speaking of the state of the country in general as a result of the insurrection, it says:
</p><p>&#8220;The minister of Foreign affairs received a telegram yesterday from General Blanco manifesting that more arrests had been made....
<milestone rend="dots" unit="tb"/>
</p><p>The conjuration had ramifications in various parts of the Archipelago, and in it figured not only masonic societies but also Bible societies....

</p><p>The propaganda of filibusterism is encharged to the colporteurs of <corr sic="evangelica">evangelical</corr> books, who wander all over the Archipelago selling protestant publications.&#8221;


</p><p id="n81"><hi rend="sc">Note 81.</hi> These three native priests were <pb id="pb259" n="259"/>among the prime movers of the rebellion of 1872, a revolt which was planned out in the houses of Joaquin Pardo de Tavera and Jacinto Zamora. The three priests were executed by the <corr sic="garote">garrote</corr> together with Francisco Saldua. Gomez left the sum of <corr sic="200.000">200,000</corr> pesos to his natural son, born to him before he entered the priesthood. In his will he strongly <corr sic="councilled">counselled</corr> his son to be ever faithful to the Spanish authorities. I had intended to give a brief outline of the revolt of &#8217;72 but space will not permit. Taking it as a whole, it differed little from the revolt of &#8217;96 with the exception that it was directly brought about by the propagators of revolutionary ideas then rampant in Spain, and by the <corr sic="emisaries">emissaries</corr> of the revolutionary government then established.

And in truth of this I swear also to be obedient in everything and to follow in the fight wherever I am led.

    </p><p>And in proof of what I have said I place my true name with the blood of my veins at the foot of this declaration.&#8221;</p></q>


</p><p id="n84"><hi rend="sc">Note 84.</hi> Pio Valenzuela, who gave some of the most interesting and reliable information concerning the inner life of the <hi>Katipunan</hi>, testified (fols. 1,663&#8211;1,673) that on the 30th of November 1895, the birthday of Bonifacio, a meeting was held in Caloocan, in a house situated in the rice fields, some thirty five or forty individuals assisting thereat, among them being the witness. This meeting continued all day and all night till the following day, the first of December. At this meeting they pronounced the death sentence upon the tailor Guzman for publishing the secrets of the <pb id="pb261" n="261"/><hi>Katipunan</hi>; this sentence was signed by all present including the witness, after he had made many observations against it, observations the rest would not listen to. One of the lighter punishments meted out was the public exposition in the lodge rooms of the picture of the person punished, with the word <hi>traitor</hi> <corr sic="writer">written</corr> over or under it.


</p><p id="n85"><hi rend="sc">Note 85.</hi> The <hi>Katipunan</hi> enjoyed a peculiar and special organization, which was given to it in order to avoid surprises and treachery. The assemblies were always held in secluded places and under the cover of the greatest secrecy. Sometimes they were held at midnight in the open cornfields so as not to attract the attention of those indians who were not members of the society. Valenzuela relates how a secret meeting was held in the pueblo of Pasig at midnight, on one <corr sic="ocassion">occasion</corr> to arrange the matter of the annexation of the Islands to Japan in case that nation did not care to declare a protectorate over them.
</p><p>The Council <corr sic="of Ministers of Ministers">of Ministers</corr> of the Supreme popular Council was as follows<corr>:</corr>

</p><p id="n86"><hi rend="sc">Note 86.</hi> Pio Valenzuela mentioned one occasion upon which such a meeting of the society was held, he himself assisting thereat, in the house of Andr&#233;s Bonifacio. It was a supper given in honor of the baptism of a child to which the said Valenzuela was god-father. After the supper, which served as a shield under the which the work of the lodge was to be done, an election was held for the Supreme and the Popular Councils, and the sections. Some thirty members were present.
</p><p>Another case he mentioned was that of a meeting held on the <corr sic="birth-day">birthday</corr> of Bonifacio 30th of November 1895.
</p><p>The Katipunan moreover had its own festivals. This is how Valenzuela describes them:
</p><p>&#8220;The Katipunan held its festival, according as Andr&#233;s Bonifacio had told the witness, on the 7th of July, anniversary of the <corr sic="fountation">foundation</corr> of the society; it also celebrated another anniversary on the 28th of February, <pb id="pb263" n="263"/>the date of the execution of the three native priests, Burgos, Gomez and Zamora (see note 81). On that day a catafalque draped with black cloth, was erected in each one of the popular Councils, having four <hi>hachones</hi><note n="a">A kind of altar on which bonfires are lighted for illumination.</note>, one in each of its four angles, adorned with crowns made with plants named <hi>Macabuhay</hi><note n="b">The name of this plant signifies that it possesses the power to bring to life again&#8212;to resuscitate.</note>. All the members filed before the funeral pile, reciting prayers for the dead and swearing to avenge the death of the three priests.


</p><p id="n87"><hi rend="sc">Note 87.</hi> Roman Baza, who was one of the many who suffered the death penalty for his treason, undertook to educate in ultra-democratic ideas, (as Isabelo de los Reyes is doing in our days), all he came in contact with. He printed and spread abroad the &#8220;rights of man&#8221; of the French revolution.
</p><p>He was at one time president of the <hi>Katipunan</hi> (see p. 44) but being a man little suited to carry out to a successful issue the set plans of the society, Bonifacio determined <pb id="pb264" n="264"/>to remove him, by what Sr. Diaz terms a <hi lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">coup-d&#8217;etat</hi>, but more properly called an underhand trick. Bonifacio, at that time treasurer, forced a conflict on the subject of the financial conditions of the society, being denounced as an exploiter for his pains. The quarrel was settled by an election, Bonifacio by his unholy influence carrying all before him.
</p><p>It was during the presidency of Baza that the Katipunan society for women was founded, &#8220;the object of which was <hi>mutual succor</hi> (!)<corr>.</corr> <corr sic="the">The</corr> institution serving at the same time to dissimulate the meetings of the male <hi>Katipuneros</hi>. Whilst the latter were holding their sessions in a retired room, the women were in the salon with some young men dancing, singing or eating. The presidentess of this society of <hi>mutual succorers</hi> was Mariana Dizon.
</p><p>To secure admission it was necessary to be a daughter or sister of one of the male members. Mariana Dizon later on married Jos&#233; Turiano Santiago, and as a result, the female <hi>Katipunan</hi>, as an organization was broken up, the late members however continuing to shield as before, the labors of the Katipunan reunions.

It is needless to say, however, that in this it has failed to receive the support of representative <corr sic="Spanniards">Spaniards</corr> who look upon such an action as little to the honor of the good name of Spain.

The motive of the conference was the proposition to Rizal of the armed rebellion, etc., etc.&#8221;
<pb id="pb266" n="266"/></p><p>Valenzuela himself spoke of this trip to Dapitan (see note <ref target="n16">16</ref>, p. 133) as follows:&#8212;
</p><p>&#8220;In the month of May of that year 1896, a reunion was held in Pasig and there it was agreed to send a commission to Japan ... and it was agreed also to commence the armed rebellion, settling the manner in which it should be carried out, but it was decided that, previous to taking action it would be wise to consult with Rizal, the witness being chosen as emissary. The schoolmaster of Cavite Viejo, by name Santos, proposed that a blind man named Raymundo Mata should accompany Valenzuela that Rizal might cure him. The witness embarked on the S. S. Venus at the end of May, meeting on board, one of Rizal&#8217;s sisters, and his (Rizal&#8217;s) <hi lang="es" xml:lang="es">querida</hi>, an American or English woman named Josefina; and arriving at Dapitan, the witness went ashore with the two women and a servant that accompanied them, making their way to the house of Rizal, etc., etc.&#8221;
</p><p>According to a statement of Isabelo de los Reyes, &#8220;Rizal, as has been clearly proved at the trials (of traitors) advised them to wait another two years, as they lacked arms.&#8221;
</p><p>I wonder if Rizal foresaw the war to <pb id="pb267" n="267"/>break out <hi>two years</hi> later between Spain and the United States! His intense desire to go to Cuba would give one that idea.


</p><p id="n90"><hi rend="sc">Note 90.</hi> Negotiations indeed! Who can imagine the circumspect and formal little nation of Japan <corr sic="admiting">admitting</corr> negotiations with a warehouse porter, a man who was representative only of the worst of the lowest classes! Sr. Diaz probably made this statement from hearsay <hi lang="es" xml:lang="es">por boca de ganso</hi> as they say in Spanish. If any negotiations took place between Bonifacio and the Japanese Government they were on a par with those between the late U. S. Consuls of Singapore and Hong-Kong, and a few other irresponsible people, and Aguinaldo, the leader of the <hi>Katipunan</hi>.


</p><p id="n91"><hi rend="sc">Note 91.</hi> As has been seen in the foregoing notes, it was the intention of the <hi>separatists</hi> to make purchases of arms and their necessary ammunition in Japan. Those wealthy <corr sic="filipinos">Filipinos</corr> who were owners of steamships were looked to as the chief assistance in the transportation and landing of the said arms, etc.
</p><p>The date of the arrival of the arms, <pb id="pb268" n="268"/>according as appeared from evidence given during the trial of Francisco L. Roxas, was to have been the 31st of December 1896. Lorenzo de la Paz, however, stated that it was the 1st of September of the said year. Others claimed it to be the 13th of September or the 30th of November. As may be easily seen, there was no lack of disagreement among the chiefs of the revolt, and perhaps, as far as the majority were concerned, still more exploitation.


</p><p id="n92"><hi rend="sc">Note 92.</hi> Pio Valenzuela y Alejandrino was a licentiate of <corr sic="Medecine">Medicine</corr>, and one of the members of the inferior Supreme Council of the Katipunan. According to his own story he entered the files of the society under compulsion at the hands of Andr&#233;s Bonifacio, who on the strength of a love affair, gave him the alternative of death or membership in the Katipunan (see p. 132). In his declaration during his trial (fol. 142&#8211;147) on the 6th of September 1896, he recorded how on the 30 day of November, S. Andrew&#8217;s day of the year 1895, he was presented by Andr&#233;s Bonifacio to various <hi>Katipuneros</hi> as &#8220;brother&#8221; Medico (Doctor), Bonifacio stating that from that time he <pb id="pb269" n="269"/>(Valenzuela) would be the doctor of the society. He also stated how, in the following month of January and in another meeting, he was nominated Fiscal, and official doctor with a salary of thirty pesos monthly, a salary he had no little difficulty in collecting. He was commissioned in May 1896 to go to Dapitan to hold a conference with Rizal concerning armed rising against the supreme authority of Spain in the Archipelago; but Rizal was shrewder and more far-sighted than the others and would not consent to the <corr sic="carryiug">carrying</corr> out of the scheme as proposed by Bonifacio. On the return of Valenzuela Bonifacio imposed upon him a strict <corr sic="sllence">silence</corr> concerning the outcome of the conference; but being pressed by certain members of the society, among whom were Emilio Jacinto, Secretary of the Supreme Council, and <hi>capita</hi> Ramon of Pandacan, he revealed the secret of Rizal&#8217;s opposition to a plan he feared would be abortive. When once the cat was out of the bag the facts soon became public among the principal members, with the result that many who had promised funds for the purchase of arms etc. in Japan, refused to pay the amounts promised. Among these was a <pb id="pb270" n="270"/>colonel of Malabon who had promised 500 pesos for the said object. This breach of confidence on the part of Valenzuela brought about the separation of himself and <corr sic="Boniiacio">Bonifacio</corr>, and the former presented his <corr sic="resignatfon">resignation</corr> as doctor and fiscal of the society. Bonifacio opposed the idea of his resignation but it was finally accepted, and the former friends parted company each to work in his own sphere.
</p><p>Valenzuela was in fact one of the chief movers of the rebellion; this was confessed by Domingo Franco, the late president of the then <corr sic="difunct">defunct</corr> <hi lang="es" xml:lang="es">Liga <corr sic="filipina">Filipina</corr></hi>. &#8220;The rebellion,&#8221; says he, &#8220;was produced by a foolish child, whose name it would dirty the tongue to pronounce, because after being the author of all (this however is somewhat inexact) has given himself up to the authorities to denounce those he has succeeded in misleading.&#8221;
</p><p>During his trial in the Bilibid prison, before Col. Francisco Olive y Garc&#237;a on the 2nd of September 1896, he gave some of the most interesting and reliable information that has yet been gathered concerning the interior workings and doings of the Katipunan.
<pb id="pb271" n="271"/></p><p>When the Guardia Civil set out from Manila to break up Bonifacio&#8217;s party in Caloocan, several of those forming the leadership fled, and among them Valenzuela. He entered Manila by way of Sampaloc, passing through Quiapo to the Escolta and down the <hi>Pasaje de P&#233;rez</hi>, embarking there on one of the lake steamers. On arrival at Bi&#241;ang he went to the house of the co-adjutor D. Silvino Manaol (native priest), to whom he recounted what had taken place. The co-adjutor asked of the parish priest the proclamation of the Governor General conceding pardon to those who should present themselves<note n="a"><p>This granting of pardon to those who should present themselves is contained in Art. 7. of the proclamation of the Governor General Blanco, issued on the 30th of August 1896, and which reads as follows:
</p><p>&#8220;Art. 7. The rebels who present themselves to the authorities within 48 hours after the publication of this proclamation, shall be exempt from punishment for rebellion, with the exception of the chiefs of the seditious groups and those who relapse into those crimes. The chiefs to whom reference is made shall be pardoned of the punishment due them if they surrender within the fixed time suffering a punishment <corr sic="immediateiy">immediately</corr> inferior according to grade.&#8221;</p></note>. Having read it with care and under the advice of the co-adjutor, he set out for the capital <pb id="pb272" n="272"/>disembarking at the Ayala bridge from whence he took a <hi lang="es" xml:lang="es">quiles</hi> and went <corr sic="immediataly">immediately</corr> to the palace of the Governor to present himself to him<corr sic=",">.</corr> The Governor General was not at home so Valenzuela at once started for the offices of the Military Government.
</p><p>Speaking of this giving up of himself of Valenzuela, Sr. Jos&#233; M. del Castillo y Jimenez says: &#8220;The forty-eight hours conceded by the proclamation of the Governor Blanco were about to close when there reached the palace of Sta. Potenciana, worn out, bathed in perspiration, and almost in a period of agony, Pio Valenzuela, an important person of revolution he being in such a condition that it was necessary to assist him previous to his passing into the presence of Gov. Blanco. When he had come to himself and was in a condition to make an explicit and ample confession he had two hours conference with the Governor, giving information of as such as he knew.&#8221;

</p><p>Apart from the Councils spoken of in this and the former paragraphs there were others formed at a later date. These were more properly variations and were as follows:
</p><p>Trozo: Popular Council <hi lang="tl" xml:lang="tl">Maypagasa</hi> with four sections, <hi>Dapitan</hi>, <hi lang="tl" xml:lang="tl">Silang&#771;anan</hi>, <hi lang="tl" xml:lang="tl">Dimasagaran</hi>, and <hi lang="tl" xml:lang="tl">Dimas-Alang.</hi>
</p><p>Palomar: Popular Council <hi>Pinkian</hi> with two sections.
</p><p>Tondo: Council <hi lang="tl" xml:lang="tl">Katagalugan</hi> with the sections <hi lang="tl" xml:lang="tl">Katutuhanan</hi>, <hi lang="tl" xml:lang="tl">Kabuhayan</hi>, <hi lang="tl" xml:lang="tl">Pagtibayan</hi>, <hi lang="tl" xml:lang="tl">Kaling&#771;aan</hi> and <hi lang="tl" xml:lang="tl">Bagong-sinag</hi> under the presidency of Alejandro Santiago, Braulio Rivera, Hilarion Cruz, Cipriano Pacheco, Nicol&#225;s Rivera and Deogracias Fajardo.
</p><p>Conception and Dilao (Paco): the Council <hi>Mahaganti</hi> presided over by Rafael Guti&#233;rrez; and the sections <hi>Panday</hi> and <hi>Ilog</hi>, with a delegation in Ermita.
</p><p>In Cavite was the popular Council <hi>Kawit</hi> the president of which was Emilio Aguinaldo<note n="a"><p>Previous to 1896 Aguinaldo was an almost unknown <hi lang="es" xml:lang="es">indio</hi>. He was at that time about 23 or <pb/>24 years of age, and like the far greater majority of the <hi lang="es" xml:lang="es">indios</hi> of the archipelago had forgotten what little he had learned at school. He was a lavandero<note n="a">Washerman.</note> for the Arsenal at Cavite, and possessed little command over the Spanish <corr sic="laguage">language</corr>, speaking it after the Cavite style, <hi lang="es" xml:lang="es">de cocina</hi> as the Spaniards say. He was the son of Carlos Aguinaldo who had several times held office under the Spanish Government, and who was at heart a bitter anti-Spaniard. Like the remainder of his fellow Tagalogs, Aguinaldo demonstrates a different character in connection with each event which takes place in his life. As <hi lang="es" xml:lang="es">capitan municipal</hi> in 1896 he was very Spanish in dealing with the authorities, but in dealing with his own people quite the reverse. Like the Taveras, the Legardas and the Buencaminos etc., he was an adept at political lightning changes. Buencamino in one of his absurd articles to the <corr sic="filipino">Filipino</corr> press (<foreign lang="es" xml:lang="es">La Independencia</foreign>, Sept. 6th 1896) speaking of him says: <corr sic="... &#8220;">&#8220;...</corr> all the <corr sic="filipinos">Filipinos</corr> unconditionally obey the president Aguinaldo seeing in him the messenger of God sent to redeem the <corr sic="filipino">Filipino</corr> people from all foreign domination, and because they see in the said chief the great virtues of fortitude, honor and magnanimity which ought to adorn all saviors of their country.&#8221;
</p><p>The belief among some <corr sic="filipinos">Filipinos</corr> that Aguinaldo was a semi-God was not uncommon at one time, and many hold to it even in these days. A certain <pb/>Bray (apparently related very closely to the bray of an ass) went a step further in an article to the <corr sic="french">French</corr> <hi lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Revue de <corr sic="Reaues">Revues</corr></hi> and compared Aguinaldo to Christ, to Alexander the Great, to Mahomet, to <corr sic="Caezar">Caesar</corr>, to Napoleon and others!
</p><p>Aguinaldo certainly demonstrated fortitude, and did not sell his sword to those he considered his enemies. His misfortune was that he fell into the hands of such advisers as Buencamino and others, who, after working up his stupid pride, deserted him in his hour of need. Aguinaldo showed fortitude and was never a traitor to what he considered the honor of his country. Honor to Aguinaldo in this respect<corr>.</corr></p></note> the <hi lang="es" xml:lang="es">capitan municipal</hi> of the pueblo of <pb id="pb274" n="274"/>Cavite Viejo and later on the dictator of the Filipino Commune.

</p><p id="n93"><hi rend="sc">Note 93.</hi> The <hi>Kalayaan</hi> was intended to be a monthly review. Its first number consisted of thirty-two pages in quarto.

</p><p>As the common belief was that this paper was published in Japan, as would appear from the paper itself, General Blanco decided <pb id="pb276" n="276"/>to send a special delegate to Japan to investigate the matter of its impression<corr>,</corr> its publishers, authors, etc., that steps might be taken to put a stop to its impression or at least that a check be put on its entry and circulation into the Philippines.

</p><p>This latter article is a mirror in which the purpose of the paper is reflected; it reads remarkably like a composition of Pedro Paterno, the visionary who claims for the peoples of the Archipelago a glorious pre-Spanish history and civilization. The following citations from the article will give some idea of the whole publication.
</p><p>&#8220;In these islands, which were previously cared for by our true neighbors of Malaysia at a time when the Spaniards had not as yet set foot upon the land, there existed a complete abundance and a state of welfare. Our friends the neighboring kingdoms, and especially Japan, brought commerce to our shores which formed the most abundant market, and there was found everything necessary, wherefore it was the richest country and its customs were all very good<note n="a">As to the goodness of customs read the testimony of the most reliable chroniclers and historians of the earliest days of Spanish history.</note>. Everyone<corr>,</corr> youths and advanced in years and even the women<corr>,</corr> could read and write according to our manner of script.&#8221;
<pb id="pb278" n="278"/></p><p>The article goes on to say that upon the arrival of the Spaniards the natives only made friends with them after that Legazpi had performed the ceremonies of the <hi lang="es" xml:lang="es">pacto-de-Sangre</hi><note n="a">The <hi lang="es" xml:lang="es">pacto de sangre</hi> was performed thus: a wound was made in the body of each person who was to form a party to the treaty about to be made, and the blood that flowed <corr sic="frem">from</corr> the wounds thus made was mixed in a receptacle prepared for the occasion; each then drank a portion of the blood thus mixed. It is needless to say that Legaspi refused to perform such a savage, <corr sic="cannabistic">cannibalistic</corr> ceremony.</note> with one of the <hi lang="es" xml:lang="es">indio</hi> petty sovereigns.
</p><p>&#8220;The Spaniards,&#8221; says the writer, &#8220;have perverted us with their bad customs and have destroyed and obliged us to forget the noble and beautiful customs of our country.&#8221;

<pb id="pb279" n="279"/></p><p id="n94"><hi rend="sc">Note 94.</hi> Pio Valenzuela testified (fols<corr>.</corr> 582&#8211;591) that on the 22nd of August he was informed by Josefa Dizon that her son Jos&#233; together with Bonifacio had fled from Manila. Valenzuela thereupon fled also, following them, and reaching Caloocan about 8 p. m. There he found Bonifacio with some twenty others. Andr&#233;s informed them that they must not <corr sic="seperate">separate</corr> as it was now time to commence the armed rebellion, the plot of the Katipunan having been discovered. From Caloocan they went to Balintauac arriving about 11 p. m. Here they met a certain Laong with a group of men. They remained in the pueblo Sunday, Monday and Tuesday preparing for the onslaught they were to make upon the Spaniards, which was fixed for the 29th of the same month, the plans being that they should advance in groups upon Manila, killing the Spaniards and also the indians and <corr sic="chinese">Chinese</corr> who refused to follow them, &#8220;<hi>dedicating themselves to the sacking of the city, robbery and incendiarism and to the violation of women</hi>.&#8221; Many <corr sic="chinese">Chinese</corr> were murdered and their stores robbed.
</p><p>Whilst in the fields of Balintauac distribution was made of bolos and ten revolvers, the latter stolen from the Maestranza <pb id="pb280" n="280"/>of Manila. On Tuesday evening preparations were made to meet the attack of the Spanish troops which had been sent out in persecution of the rebels, and the first conflict took place. Valenzuela also stated that the greater part of the people who formed the rebel forces were drawn, catechised and initiated all in a moment by the fanatic Laong, who was practically the active chief of the revolt, and who directed in person the attack upon the <corr sic="chinese">Chinese</corr> stores.
</p><p>About 5 pm. on the 29th<corr sic="."/> five hundred men under a &#8220;leader of Pasig&#8221; appeared on the scene at the waterworks. They at once took possession of the building and of the persons of the workmen. Their first intention was to stop the machinery so that no one need be left in charge thereof when orders should be received for a start for Manila. The engineer however, reminded the chief that if such a thing was done their brethren in Manila would die of thirst. This excuse carried the day and the chief decided to leave some workmen there under the condition that the engineer and others who wore moustaches should shave, and that all should dress like indians, and that the engineer&#8217;s wife should dress like a native woman <pb id="pb281" n="281"/>and prepare food for his men. The party finally set out on their way. They tried to avoid an encounter with the <corr sic="trops">troops</corr> composed of artillery and infantry, 65 men in all, stationed at the powder works. In avoiding this handful of defenders they fell afoul of other troops which gave them a good sharp reception.
</p><p>As to those who, repenting, desired to return to a legal status, it is difficult to form an opinion, on account of the contrary evidence adduced in connection therewith. Isabelo de los Reyes already cited, in a futile attempt to justify the acts of the Katipuneros, claims that some of the chiefs opposed the plan of the armed resistance as contained in the propositions of Bonifacio, claiming that <corr sic="ti">it</corr> would be a great and useless sacrifice, to say nothing of the imprudence of such an act, to launch forth against an armed force without possessing better arms than a few bolos and lances. He claims that Bonifacio listened to the advice and was on the point of acting upon it, but was compelled to take the step he did in declaring the revolt, by the attitude of his 500 followers. The authority for this statement was Pedro Nicodemus, who was the commander of the said <pb id="pb282" n="282"/>group, a man who was as ignorant as he was blood-thirsty.
</p><p>Further on Isabelo states that &#8220;in the famous reunion of <corr sic="Balintanac">Balintauac</corr>, in the solemn moment of the breaking forth of the revolt (August, 26th 1896) <corr sic="Andres">Andr&#233;s</corr> Bonifacio as president of the Supreme Council of the Katipunan, explained that the plot had been discovered, and that in order to save those who were compromised and who had not up to that time been arrested, it was necessary to launch forth to the fight, although the arms with which they should fight had not yet arrived from Japan.&#8221;
</p><p>Granted however the character of Bonifacio, his aims and the methods he adopted to carry out his ideas, such an excuse as that of Reyes argue but little in pro of the good judgement or better said the good faith of its author. Bonifacio was anxious for the first blow of the revolt to be struck that he might not <corr sic="loose">lose</corr> the confidence of those who had intrusted him with the undertaking and who had been fooled into the idea that the Katipunan forces were so powerful that nothing could resist their onward course once they had been started on their way. And to suppose that Bonifacio <pb id="pb283" n="283"/>was to be so easily influenced by a few petty chiefs is to show a complete ignorance of the character of the hero of the Katipunan. If the opposition of the said petty chiefs really occurred it was probably inspired more by fear of the consequences than by the true spirit of repentance, for if the cruelties and abuses said to have been committed by the Spaniards were the cause of the revolt, what need was there of such a repentance?
</p><p>The prestige enjoyed by Bonifacio among the katipuneros was natural enough, in as much as he was the father of the <hi>Katipunan</hi>, the illegitimate offspring of filipino freemasonry, itself a legitimate child of the Spanish family of universal freemasonry.
</p><p>&#8220;The <corr sic="katipunan">Katipunan</corr>,&#8221; says the author of an exposition to Congress, dated 1900 and published at the printing office of the <hi lang="es" xml:lang="es">El Liberal</hi>, &#8220;the worthy and legitimate<note n="a">Worthy perhaps but certainly not legitimate. The Katipunan was illegitimate from all points <corr sic="ef">of</corr> view; nor was it a child really of Bonifacio. The conception was of Pilar (Marcelo H.) and Bonifacio was but the foster father encharged with the bringing up of the child.</note> child of Andr&#233;s Bonifacio, was founded in his <pb id="pb284" n="284"/>own house in calle Sagunto (Tondo) between six and seven in the evening of the 7th of July 1892. Andr&#233;s Bonifacio gathered together his best friends, Teodoro Plata, Valentin D&#237;az, Ladislao <corr sic="Diua">Dina</corr>, Deodato <corr sic="Arelano">Arellano</corr>, and Ildefonso Laurel, to whom he proposed the necessity of the creation of that Superior Association of the Sons of the People, whose only aim should be that of the independence of the people under a Spanish protectorate or in default of that, of Japan. Those assembled took to the idea with great enthusiasm and at once commenced the propaganda of the same.


</p><p id="n95"><hi rend="sc">Note 95.</hi> One thing which clearly demonstrates the state of fanaticism and moral degradation to which the <hi>Katipunan</hi> fell, was the savage manner in which they treated the Religious prisoners who fell into their hands. Disrespect for all authority and especially that of the clergy, was one of the chief fruits of the work of propaganda carried on by Rizal and other of the <corr sic="seperatist">separatist</corr> element, aided and abetted by the Bible societies who gave moral as well as practical assistance to their labors.
</p><p>As fanaticism increased, this want of respect <pb id="pb285" n="285"/>became more intense and eventually led to a thirst for the blood of those whose greatest crime was the excessive favor they had extended to the indian, to whom such a thing as gratitude was unknown<note n="a">A <corr sic="peoples,">people&#8217;s</corr> language is the expression of its sentiments<corr sic=",">.</corr> There are in this archipelago, native languages in <corr sic="the "/>which no word exists to express &#8220;thank you.&#8221;</note>.
</p><p>As we have seen, the intention of the Katipuneros was the annihilation of the Spaniards, irrespective of class or condition. The parish priest being the strongest support of the administration was the target for the bitterest treatment at the hands of the rebels.
</p><p>Among the number of those parish priests murdered by the <corr sic="tagalog">Tagalog</corr> rebels were P. Toribio Moreno; Recolet, parish priest of Silang; P. Toribio Mateo, Recolet and parish priest of Perez Dasmari&#241;as; and the lay brothers: fray Luis Garbayo and Julian Umbon, these latter were murdered in San Francisco de Malabon. Upon the Estate of Imus, then property of the Recolet Corporation, now in the possession of a large London Syndicate, were most brutally murdered the following Recolets:
<pb id="pb286" n="286"/></p><p>P. Jos&#233; Ma. Learte, ex-Provincial and parish priest of Imus, P. Simeon Marin, ex-Definitor and parish priest of Maragondon, P. Agipito Echegoyen, parish priest of Amadeo, P. Faustino Lizasoain, parish priest of Bailen, and the lay-brothers:
</p><p>Roman Caballero, Jorge Zueco del Rosario, Damaso Go&#241;i, Bernardo Angos, Victoriano L&#243;pez.
</p><p>It is affirmed by eye-witnesses that these victims to <corr sic="tagalog">Tagalog</corr> fanaticism were saturated with petroleum and burned alive.
</p><p>Fear was entertained for the safety of of several Dominican Fathers who held parishes near by, and therefore P. Buenaventura Campa, P. Francisco Cabe&#241;as and fray Natalio Esparza immediately set out in search for them. Regardless of the great risk they ran in falling into the hands of the bloodthirsty Katipuneros, these three heroic Dominicans casting aside all thought for <corr sic="sel">self</corr> and all care for their own welfare<note n="a">F. Buenaventura Campa was one of the two Dominican Fathers who willingly devoted themselves to the care of the sufferers stricken with the cholera plague which has carried off so many people both in Manila and the provinces. He, together with his companion, P. C&#225;ndido, bore with remarkable patience <pb/>and self-abnegation the troubles and trials consequent upon the extraordinary plans adopted by an inexperienced Sanitary Department for the treatment of the dread enemy.</note> set out <pb id="pb287" n="287"/>for Naic in the steam launch <hi>Mariposa</hi>. Difficulties were encountered from the start. The native captain and engineer conspired to prevent the carrying out of the attempted rescue. P. Buenaventura calling up the refractory captain told him that he and his companions were firm in their purpose and that progress must be made. The captain pleaded inability for want of coal. Then hoist the sails, said P. Campa. There are none replied the captain. Then take my habit and those of my companions and make<corr sic=","/> sails of them, thundered the Padre. The captain gave in and the journey was continued. Naic was reached; they failed to find their companions but were in time to save the unfortunate wife and children of Lieut. Perez Herrero; they discovered them barefooted and wellnigh mad with terror, dressed in native clothes and hidden in a <hi>nipa</hi> shack. P. Galo Minguez, parish priest of Naic, Padres Nicol&#225;s Pe&#241;a and Jos&#233; Digne and the laybrothers Saturnino Garc&#237;a and Jos&#233; Pedida had succeeded in escaping from the <pb id="pb288" n="288"/>clutches of the rebellious <corr sic="tagalogs">Tagalogs</corr>, having fled to Labay from whence they made their way to Corregidor, meeting there those who had come to seek them in the <hi>Mariposa</hi>.
</p><p>The Augustinian Father P. Piernavieja was another victim to fanaticism. This Father has been termed <hi lang="es" xml:lang="es">medio loco</hi><note n="a">Half mad.</note> and in all truth he was so if the possession of a presence of mind such as that shown by P. Piernavieja is to be termed craziness. True it is that he was at times gifted with a strange turn of mind. He had, during the many years he administered the parish, established therein a christian communism. When the revolt broke out he was held as a prisoner and obliged to invest himself with the authority of an Archbishop. Had the revolt prospered and P. Piernavieja lived, undoubtedly he would have been made Archbishop of Manila by the <corr sic="tagalog">Tagalog</corr> discontents. P. Piernavieja was shrewd enough to take well to his new office. He was once called upon to <corr sic="annoint">anoint</corr> the chiefs and rulers, as the kings and emperors of olden time were <corr sic="annointed">anointed</corr> by the Church. Padre Piernavieja told them that olive oil was not <pb id="pb289" n="289"/>suitable for such a purpose and therefore proceeded to anoint them with <hi>cocoanut</hi> oil such as is used by the natives for their lamps! Under pretext of his office of Bishop this strange old man claimed liberty to make his pastoral visits and when he succeeded in securing this liberty which was readily granted to him, he overran all that part of the province in the hands of the insurgents, secretly collecting all kinds of information, which he immediately sent his superiors in Manila. This information reached the military authorities and would have become of utility to them for the carrying out of the campaign had it been prosecuted as a military campaign should have been. But the Padre&#8217;s messenger was eventually captured with messages in his possession. When questioned as to the source of the information, and where he was taking it, he told all, and as a result Padre Piernavieja was condemned to death as a traitor to a cause to which he had never held allegiance. As a punishment he was tied to a tree exposed to the burning rays of the tropical sun, and thus left to the mercy of the voracious birds and insects, <pb id="pb290" n="290"/>dying of hunger, thirst and of terror in the midst of inconceivable torments.
</p><p>Padre David Veras, Dominican, was another of the many victims of the <hi lang="es" xml:lang="es">Katipuneros</hi>. He was the parish priest of the pueblo of Hermosa in the province of Bataan. When the insurgents attacked the pueblo they captured P. David, and after cutting <corr sic="of">off</corr> both his hands, dragged him to the most distant of the ten <hi lang="es" xml:lang="es">barrios</hi> of that pueblo, and there hacked him to death with <hi lang="es" xml:lang="es">bolos</hi> and hatchets mutilating his body in a horrible manner, and throwing the corpse on to a dung heap.
</p><p>In the early dawn of the 25th of December 1896, in Morong province of Bataan, Padre Domingo Cabrejas, Recolet, was murdered at the altar while offering up the holy sacrifice of the Mass, his blood staining the sacred linen and the steps of the altar. The <hi lang="es" xml:lang="es">katipunero</hi> murderers <corr sic="huriedly">hurriedly</corr> hid the body in the church and fled.
</p><p>Padre Jos&#233; Sanjuan, also Recolet and parish priest of Bagac was another victim. To name all those who suffered barbarous treatment at the <hi>merciful</hi> hands of the insurgents would be a well-nigh impossible task. Recalling the acts of those fanaticised sectarians, one might almost recall the <pb id="pb291" n="291"/>barbarities and brutalities of the diabolical Nero. Certainly the ancient Chinese and Japanese were scarcely more excessive in their treatment of the unfortunate missionaries they tortured in their attempt to stamp out the christian faith; and even the Chinese <hi>boxers</hi> of our days could have taken lessons from the disciples of <corr sic="filipino">Filipino</corr> freemasonry. Many, many are the unfortunate missionaries whose blood cries to heaven for <corr sic="vengance">vengeance</corr> and this <corr sic="vengance">vengeance</corr> of the God of Justice will one day fall upon this people. Even in our own days we cannot shut our eyes to the fact of the existence of the well marked track of the hand of Divine Justice as it passes here and there throughout the land, calling now upon this one, now upon that, to pay his debt even to the last farthing. The track of the finger of God has been remarkably distinct in this archipelago and many are the cases in which that finger moving slowly and silently along has pointed out the unfruitful tree which the scythe of death shall cut down.
</p><p>&#8220;For I the Lord <corr sic="they">thy</corr> God am a jealous God; visiting the sins of the fathers upon the children until the third and fourth generation.&#8221;


<pb id="pb292" n="292"/></p><p id="n96"><hi rend="sc">Note 96.</hi> Some there are who see in every event which takes place, the protecting or avenging hand of Providence. Others there are who laugh to scorn the idea that Providence should concern itself in such matters.
</p><p>The hand of Providence surely has manifested itself of late in this archipelago, here protecting the one from a cruel torture, there permitting the <corr sic="sacrifiece">sacrifice</corr> of a martyr to the faith or a martyr to duty and honor, and the integrity of the Spanish nation. Here giving one over to a just punishment, there pointing out another as an object for Divine <corr sic="vengance">vengeance</corr>.
</p><p>Is proof needed perhaps that the finger of the avenging hand of Divine justice has left its well-marked path in the Philippines? Then we have a notable case before us. A few months ago, a steamer, the Rio de Janeiro, left the Orient bound for the port of San Francisco, Cal. Within sight of the city, almost within sight of the crowds who stood upon the wharf in expectation of the ship&#8217;s arrival, the good vessel, by the will of God who rules over all things, went to the bottom, carrying with her, among other passengers, a man who was morally and physically <pb id="pb293" n="293"/>responsible for the greater part of the barbarities practiced upon the long suffering Spanish prisoners, Religious, Civil and Military, at the hands of the Tagalog revolutionists. With that man disappeared from the land of the living his whole family, together with state and private papers of unknown value. How often before in the past history of the world has the God of Justice obliterated whole families and even whole nations!
</p><p>And who shall say that the hand of Divine Justice has not protected as well as avenged. For many months the katipuneros had woven a fine-meshed net around the Spanish population of the Philippines, a labor the more easily accomplished in the same degree as the scandalous carelessness of the Blanco administration became more and more marked. Blanco himself was a freemason<note n="a">Juan Utor y Fernandez (bro&#8756; <hi>Espartero</hi>) confessed that Blanco was a freemason; he affirmed also that his masonic name was bro&#8756; <hi>Barcelona</hi>. Lacasa, Lieut. Auditor of war, and one of the heads of freemasonry in the Philippines declared that among the freemasons of the archipelago was <corr sic="countted">counted</corr> Sr. D. Ramon Blanco, Capt Gen<corr sic=",">.</corr> of the Army and Gov. Gen. of the Islands.</note> and was always, like our present <pb id="pb294" n="294"/>civil administration, surrounded by friends of his own choice, people who at no time suffered from an excess of patriotism; and the few honorable exceptions which did exist were, unfortunately, persons whose good moral influence was powerless to better a situation which day by day became worse<note n="a"><p>The following interesting notes will give some idea of what the Blanco administration was like.
</p><p>In the report of the secret police for the 3rd of June 1896, appears the following:&#8212;
</p><p>&#8220;Notice is hereby given of the confidential information given by a freemason in respect to the reason why the masonic lodges are at rest, and the attitude of Generals Blanco and Echaluce in regard to the same.
</p><p>&#8220;This freemason, Juan Merchan, says: &#8220;we are now sleeping; we cannot work; we are tutored by the experience of the persecution directed against us by General Echaluce. Until General Blanco returns from Mindanao we can do nothing, for he at least does not disturb us, and even helps us. The proof of this is that during the previous voyage to Mindanao (of Blanco) Gen. Echaluce commenced<corr sic=","/> to deport people; but when Blanco got to know of it, he wrote to him ordering him not to deport anyone without his consent, and not to do anything in the matter till his return from Mindanao.&#8221;</p></note>.
</p><p>This net already woven was set, and it needed but the given signal for its string to be tightly drawn and the unsuspecting <pb id="pb295" n="295"/>prey would immediately fall into its folds, to be redeemed only by a barbarous, cruel death. But providence is merciful as well as just, and in her own time opened up a way of escape for the coveted prize of the <hi>katipunero</hi> savages. This opening was no other than Teodoro Pati&#241;o, himself a member of the diabolical society, the plot of which he was to reveal.
</p><p>Pati&#241;o was one of the many compositors in the printing establishment of the <hi lang="es" xml:lang="es">Diario de Manila</hi><corr sic=",">.</corr> He was an indian of but little importance both as regards his abilities as a workman or as a <hi>katipunero</hi>: he was one of the thousands of unknowns from which have sprung so many of those sadly famous <hi lang="es" xml:lang="es">ignorantes</hi> and others of our own days. But he was destined to act an important part in the society to which he belonged: a part however not in the programme of proceedings drawn up by the society.
</p><p>A <corr sic="discusion">discussion</corr> took place one day as to the subscription the said Pati&#241;o should pay into the common funds of the society, and heated words passed between him and his companions on the subject. From words they came to blows; and as Pati&#241;o was one against many he came out of the <corr sic="tussel">tussle</corr> <pb id="pb296" n="296"/>second best, having received a good sound thrashing for daring to differ from the majority. To satisfy his injured feelings he looked around him for some one from whom he could expect sympathy, and he bethought himself of his sister who was a pupil of the College of Mandaloya, under the care of the Augustinian Nuns. To his sister he repaired and to her he told his tale of woe, making mention at the same time of a certain society to which he and his assailants belonged.
</p><p>The sister startled by what her brother related, questioned him closely, as only a woman can question when she wishes to get to the bottom of anything. Having been a pupil of the Augustinian Nuns for a considerable time and preserving in her heart sentiments of gratitude little known among the peoples of the Archipelago, she was much hurt to hear of the plans mapped out by the <hi>Katipunan</hi> for the brutal destruction of those who had always been so good and kind to her and her brother. And before Pati&#241;o could tell all his tale, his sister had bidden him good-bye and gone off in search of the Mother Superior of the College, to whom she immediately told all she knew of the affair. The two women trembling <pb id="pb297" n="297"/>with fear for the safety of the lives of so many hundreds of innocent victims, hurriedly <corr sic="saught">sought</corr> the presence of the Rev. Padre Mariano Gil, Augustinian, and parish priest of Tondo. This Rev. Father, realizing the enormity of the <hi>Katipunan</hi> plot, advised them to send Pati&#241;o to him without delay.
</p><p>Pati&#241;o presented himself at the <hi lang="es" xml:lang="es">convento</hi> and underwent a close examination at the hands of Padre Mariano. At first little progress was made, as Pati&#241;o feared both the anger of the authorities and that of his fellow <hi lang="es" xml:lang="es">katipuneros</hi>, who would doubtless take revenge upon him according to the laws of the society, for his tale-telling. And in spite of the fact that he tried at every turn to avoid telling the naked truth, and to escape here and there by professions of ignorance, he eventually manifested to P. Mariano Gil all he knew of the society, of its plans and of its resources. After a long and tedious conversation, the patriotic Augustinian was gratified with the knowledge of where to lay his hands upon hidden documents etc., which would throw much light upon the purposes of the society of cut-throats. P. Gil immediately set to work to disclose the hidden secrets.
<pb id="pb298" n="298"/></p><p>&#8220;Without <corr sic="loosing">losing</corr> a moment,&#8221; writes P. Mariano Gil, to a friend who had asked of him the true story of what took place on that memorable occasion, &#8220;I sent notice to the Lieut. of the <hi>Veterana</hi> of this sub-division, D. Jos&#233; Cort&#233;s, to whom in the presence of the denouncer, Pati&#241;o, I communicated the most necessary data, giving him at the same time the names of all those persons in the printing establishment who were compromised, commencing with the two who signed the receipts, Policarpo Tarla and Braulio Rivera, indicating to him the manner of procedure for the detention of all those complicated.
<milestone rend="dots" unit="tb"/>
</p><p>... &#8220;I decided, confiding in God, to go alone to the printing establishment, at a time when none of the workmen should be present.&#8221;
</p><p>The writer goes on <corr sic="the">to</corr> explain how he made known his mission to D. Ram&#243;n Montes and two other Spaniards who, astonished at the news, aided in the search for the documents, stones etc. After a half hour&#8217;s search the <corr sic="lithograpic">lithographic</corr> stone was discovered, and like a tiger springing upon its prey, the zealous son of St. Augustine pounced <pb id="pb299" n="299"/>upon it, as though he feared that the very roof of the building should fall in upon it and bury it beneath its rubbish out of reach of his hands. A proof was taken from the said stone, of the <hi>Katipunero</hi> receipts, and P. Gil immediately set off in the direction of the <hi>Veterana</hi> of Tondo where he met Pati&#241;o, who recognized the receipt as authentic, and two hours later the Patriotic Augustinian saw his efforts crowned with the confession of guilt of the delinquents, the two previously named, figuring at the head of the list. Having performed this, P. Gil humbly wended his way back to his parochial dwelling, satisfied to have been an instrument of divine Providence for the unravelling of one of the most bloodthirsty plots ever invented by the perverse mind of embruted mankind.
</p><p>At midnight was discovered in the locker of Policarpo Tarla, in the same place, a dagger, the regulations of the Katipunan and several documents having connection with the said society, all of which, together with the famous lithographic stone<corr>,</corr> were handed over by Sr. Montes to the <hi>Veterana</hi>.
</p><p>On the following day P. Gil discovered <pb id="pb300" n="300"/>in the house of one of his <corr sic="parishoners">parishioners</corr> a dagger identical to the one mentioned, also several receipts in Tagalog with the key of the symbolic language in which they were printed.
</p><p>&#8220;This&#8221;, affirms P. Gil, &#8220;is the truth of the discovery.&#8221;
</p><p>There can be little doubt that Pati&#241;o was directly inspired more by the thrashing he received than by providence, although it is not possible to deny that the thrashing and the consequent divulging of the secrets of the <hi>Katipunan</hi> were providential. And as regards to his <corr sic="repentence">repentance</corr>, I doubt judging from the character of the average indian, whether he really felt repentant till the enormity of the crime to which he was an <corr sic="abbetor">abettor</corr> was brought home to him by P. Mariano Gil. Be that as it may. The ways of Providence are hidden from us and we can seldom see, with our human eyes, more than the actions of the human reason. Yet the truth remains, that whether directly or indirectly inspired by providence it was <corr sic="Patino&#8217;s">Pati&#241;o&#8217;s</corr> action which saved Spain &#8220;from an unending series of bitter experiences.&#8221;


<pb id="pb301" n="301"/></p><p id="n97"><hi rend="sc">Note 97.</hi> What has, up to this present, been written concerning these stirring events has been taken chiefly from the reports made by Gen. Blanco to Sr. Canovas. Whether from ignorance or from malice, these reports contained about as many errors as words. From these Sr. Diaz evidently took the statement that the sister of Pati&#241;o was a pupil in the College of Looban, whereas P. Mariano Gil himself states that it was that known as the Orphan Asylum for Girls at Mandaloya.


</p><p id="n98"><hi rend="sc">Note 98.</hi> The following sketch of P. Mariano Gil is taken from the <hi>Heraldo de Madrid</hi> which in its number of the 6th October 1896, said:
</p><p>&#8220;P. Gil was born in Carreon de los Condes (Palencia) on the 2nd of July 1849. Whilst still young he entered the Augustinian College of Valladolid. His studies concluded, he passed to the Philippines where he filled the duties of parish priest in several Tagalog pueblos. Till recently he has been holding the position of parish priest of Tondo, a suburb of Manila. He was fortunate enough to discover the plot of the insurrection on the 19th of August last, <pb id="pb302" n="302"/>denouncing it at an opportune moment. The Spaniards gathered in manifestation to the palace of the Governor General; Sr. Blanco did not condescend to receive them and they therefore went at once to pay their respects to P. Gil and the Archbishop, both of whom congratulated them for their patriotic attitude. A newspaper of Manila, <hi lang="es" xml:lang="es">El Espa&#241;ol</hi>, published the picture of the parish priest of Tondo; but scarcely had the first copies of the paper appeared on the street, than General Blanco ordered their suppression, commanding that a new edition be printed omitting the said picture and the laudatory phrases which the <hi lang="es" xml:lang="es">El Espa&#241;ol</hi> had dedicated to the eminent Augustinian, from this time a note-worthy patriot to whom the public did a justice which General Blanco either did not know how, or did not wish to do him.&#8221;
</p><p>Speaking of this patriotic Padre, Sr. Castillo y Jimenez<note n="a">El Katipunan, etc.; p. 89.</note> says:


<figure id="mgil" rend="image(images/mgil.gif)"/>

</p><p>&#8220;His character is gruff; he asks nothing, he demands; he does not beseech, he asks; and what he demands and asks is just and lawful, because it bears in its essence the <pb id="pb303" n="303"/>benefit of mankind, aiding the unfortunate, warding off their dangers, delivering them from the attacks which envy and <corr sic="vengance">vengeance</corr> might deal out to pacific and humble people. He is inflexible with the reprobate and disloyal, magnanimous with those who have been deceived; proud with the haughty and humble with the weak, and in his generous life has wiped away many tears, distributed much bread to the poor, and many times proportioned assistance to the needy that they should not fall into want.&#8221;
</p><p>The good work done in the discovery of the diabolical plot of the <hi>Katipunan</hi>, has very naturally been the object of a great amount of bitter criticism at the hands of the <corr sic="seperatist">separatist</corr> element, which has never pardoned the valiant Augustinian for springing their carefully laid traps<corr sic=",">.</corr> He was denounced in the lodge rooms of <corr sic="filipino">Filipino</corr> freemasonry, from one of which was despatched a letter directed to him and bearing his picture, as will be seen in the accompanying illustration. His discovery was depreciated and belittled, and made to appear a farce. His patriotism was called into question and his very life was placed in imminent danger.
<pb id="pb304" n="304"/></p><p>However the torrents of lies that have poured forth against him have not, and can not obliterate the truth.
</p><p>Isabelo de los Reyes to belittle the labors of discovery of P<corr>.</corr> Gil, affirms that Antonio Luna notified Blanco of the existence of the association previous to the discovery of P. Gil. Be that as it may; the secret police had also notified Blanco of what was going on<corr sic=";">.</corr> Three times did the Archbishop of Manila do the same, and so also did the other prelates of Manila and Prior of the Convent of Guadalupe, and Lieut. Sityer<note n="a">Blanco, whether because he was bound by compromise, or because of fear, heeded not the warnings of the approaching danger. <corr sic="Aa">As</corr> a soldier face to face with an enemy Blanco was not lacking in courage; but when the enemy was invisible, and more tact than courage was needed in the combat, Blanco was like a little child in the dark, frightened at the least sound&#8212;chicken hearted. It is certainly a remarkable thing that bro&#8756; <hi>Barcelona</hi> had the courage to pass through the ordeals of his initiation into freemasonry.</note>. But this does not lessen the value of Padre Gil&#8217;s discovery, but rather adds to its importance. For whilst Blanco was sufficiently posted on the matter to be able to judge of the necessity of taking immediate proceedings, <pb id="pb305" n="305"/>there was wanting that healthy stimulus which was given by P. Gil. A stubborn carbuncle often needs the aid of the lance: P. Gil&#8217;s discovery was the lance which brought to the surface the putrid matter which nature could not, of herself, eject. This putrid matter extending itself, would have brought about the mortification of the whole body, had not the surgeon applied his lance in good time. And although the lance of the surgeon brought pain to the patient it saved her for the time, giving back to her a state of relative health.


</p><p id="n99"><hi rend="sc">Note 99.</hi> The first executions which took place were those of four rebels captured <hi>in <corr sic="fraganti">flagrante</corr></hi> in San Juan del Monte. These were Sancho Valenzuela, Eugenio Silvestre, Modesto Sarmiento and Ram&#243;n Peralta. Of these Valenzuela was the only one of any importance. Sarmiento was a <hi lang="es" xml:lang="es">cabeza de barangay</hi><note n="a">The head of a pueblo. The most ancient form of rule in the Archipelago.</note> of Santa Ana where he owned a small <hi>nipa</hi> house which he rented out, performing at the same time the office of cook and house boy to the tenant. <pb id="pb306" n="306"/>On the way to execution he met his tenant-master and, in a nonchalant manner, greeted him with as pleasant a <hi>Buenos dias Se&#241;or</hi>, as if he were on the way to some joyous function or a grand &#8220;meet&#8221; at the cock-pit. Before his execution Valenzuela also showed a spirit of coolness and serenity, signing his last will and testament with a firm hand, and smiling. Both showed the spirit of men thoroughly <corr sic="facinated">fascinated</corr> by some superior power<corr sic="."/>, neither realizing the crime they had committed nor the punishment they were to undergo.
</p><p>The second execution took place in Cavite, thirteen rebels being shot. These were Francisco Osorio<corr sic=".">,</corr> Maximo Inocencio, Luis Aguado, Victoriano Luciano, Hugo <corr sic="Perez">P&#233;rez</corr>, Jos&#233; Lallana, Antonio San Agustin, Agapito Conchu, Feliciano Cabuco, Mariano Gregorio, Eugenio Cabezas <corr sic="aud">and</corr> two constables of the public prison of the province. These constables had pressed into their traitorous service a number of the <hi lang="es" xml:lang="es">muchachos</hi> of the prison. Francisco Osorio was a very wealthy <corr sic="chinese">Chinese</corr> <corr sic="halfcaste">half-caste</corr>. He had been honored by Spain with several honors, among them the Grand Cross of Carlos III. He was very intimate with the <pb id="pb307" n="307"/>authorities in Cavite. His father, a wealthy <corr sic="chinee">Chinee</corr>, and his cousin, a doctor, both denounced him at the moment of his execution.
</p><p>&#8220;After the reading of the sentence,&#8221; says an eye-witness, &#8220;in front of the square which we formed, he commenced to cry, asking pardon of the General and of all Spaniards; he affirmed that he was a Spaniard and that he would never conspire again against the country in which he had been educated, and he cursed the freemasons who in Madrid had initiated him into the hatred of religion and the fatherland. The doctor his cousin, turning to him, said: <hi>Silence Osorio! <corr sic="dont">don&#8217;t</corr> cry so; what will the Spaniards benefit from your repentance</hi>; but the miserable fellow paid no attention to him, and asked to be allowed to kiss the Spanish flag before he died. This permission was not granted.&#8221;
</p><p>Maximo Inocencio was the proprietor of a large store and was a contractor to the Arsenal. He had been previously arrested for implication in the revolt in Cavite in 1872. At that time he escaped but was afterwards pardoned; the signal rocket was to be fired from his storehouse in Cavite.
</p><p>Luis Aguado was also a contractor for the Arsenal.
<pb id="pb308" n="308"/></p><p>Victoriano Luciano, a chemist, was a wealthy half-caste who had not lived long in Cavite.
</p><p>Hugo P&#233;rez, was an <hi lang="es" xml:lang="es">indio</hi>. He was the venerable of the masonic lodge. In his house were discovered two large photographs in which the majority of the thirteen persons executed were photographed in the form of a triangle; a book with a triangle and other masonic insignia on its front page, and four important letters of anti-Spanish masonic propaganda.
</p><p>Lallana was a tailor, and some say a peninsular Spaniard. For a while he was chief of police of Cavite and had been a corporal of Marines.
</p><p>Antonio San Agustin was an indian, a petty merchant and a man who could scarcely bear the sight of a Spaniard.
</p><p>Agapito Conchu was a master of a primary school, and a half-caste. He had once been detained in the time of Despujols but granted his liberty. Apart from his school, he gave lessons to some of the children of the Spanish families of the town, including the daughter of the Governor of Cavite.
</p><p>Cabuco was an <hi lang="es" xml:lang="es">escribiente</hi><note n="a">See page 63.</note> of the administration <pb id="pb309" n="309"/>of State; and Eugenio Cabezas a watch-tinker.
</p><p>These executions were followed by that of a member of the Guardia <hi>Civil</hi>, Mariano Magno, in Nueva Ecija. Magno had always been noted for his lack of obedience to his superiors, his hatred of discipline and ill-feeling in general towards Spaniards. Fifteen others were shot in Iligan on the 28th of October of the same year. Many others suffered the like penalty in different parts of the Archipelago.


</p><p id="n100"><hi rend="sc">Note 100.</hi> Those sentenced to deportation were, for the most part, sent to Jolo, Puerta Princesa, Balabac and to the penitentiary colonies.
</p><p>To the first named place were sent 69 persons of all kinds and conditions, trades and occupations. Among them was a Juan Cuadra, a chemist in Ermita. To Puerta Princesa went 53, and to Balabac 56 both lots well assorted. Those most compromised in the insurrection were sent to Fernando Poo, these numbering some 200. Three hundred more were sent to Mindanao. Among the 200 sent to Fernando Poo were merchants, compositors, silversmiths, book-binders, <pb id="pb310" n="310"/>carriage painters, laundrymen, <hi lang="es" xml:lang="es">escribientes</hi>, a clerk of the Puerta del Sol on the Escolta, hat-makers, tailors, laborers, students, lawyers and among them the <corr sic="irrepresible">irrepressible</corr> jack-in-the-box, Thomas William of the Rosary (Tomas G. del Rosario); telephone operators, school-teachers and three members of the secret police; among the rag and tag of the good-for-nothings, and as chief of them, was the famous <hi>translator</hi> of the scriptures, Pascual H. Poblete<note n="a"><p>Pascual H. Poblete: a <hi lang="es" xml:lang="es">pobre diablo</hi> who speaks Spanish like a chino and writes it far worse.

The subscription lists he has <pb/>started for various pious or patriotic objects are well nigh innumerable.
</p><p>The <hi lang="es" xml:lang="es">Heraldo de Madrid</hi>, of the 19th of November 1896, says of this charlatan:
</p><p>&#8220;Well paired with Tom&#225;s del Rosario, the <hi lang="es" xml:lang="es">indio</hi> who, by literary fraud gained from Se&#241;or Nu&#241;ez de Arce a good position in the Philippines, is Pascual H. Poblete also an <hi lang="es" xml:lang="es">indio</hi><note n="a">If I am not in error, Poblete is <corr sic="in">a</corr> <corr sic="chinee">Chinee</corr> halfcaste.</note> and a person of history too.
</p><p>&#8220;His first steps in work in the newspapers of his country were as translator of the Spanish text of a bilingual review into Tagalog.
</p><p>&#8220;He propagated political themes widely, but above all, those articles of the Civil and Penal code <pb/>favorable to his countrymen; to these articles he added comments.... Under the pretext of competing with the Chinese he founded a cooperative association which was the subject of much talk. It was really nothing else than an association distinctly political and eminently anti-Spanish. He however <corr sic="suceeded">succeeded</corr> in dissimulating, and when he created the newspaper <hi lang="es" xml:lang="es">El Resumen</hi>, placed a peninsular <corr sic="Spanniard">Spaniard</corr>, a native of Aragon, at its head. He then did all he could to gain the confidence of Despujols, whom he visited every once in a while.
</p><p>&#8220;As Despujols step by step lost favor with the <pb/>European element, Poblete praised him more and more and this was, in itself, a good sign of the direction in which was going this Poblete, a man lacking talent, lacking wit, and enjoying nothing but an insane intention. During the last years he made continuous anti-Spanish propaganda, and was a bitter enemy of the Spaniards, excepting some few degenerates who yet believed in the good faith of this <hi lang="es" xml:lang="es">pobre diablo</hi>.&#8221;
</p><p>In later days he changed his religion&#8212;that is if he ever had one to change, and devoted himself to sponging upon the Bible Societies and the protestant and Mormon missionaries who came to the Philippines. On one occasion he <hi>translated</hi> from Spanish into Tagalog the Holy Scriptures, and seeing that never in his life had he been a successful translator even of newspaper paragraphs, but could only <pb/>succeed in giving little more than a very general idea of what was contained in the Spanish text, it was not to be wondered at that, as a famous literary critic well versed in the Tagalog once said: &#8220;Poblete&#8217;s Tagalog bible reads more like a badly written chronicle than a version of the sacred Scriptures. If I thought that our Lord and his Apostles preached and taught what Poblete puts into their mouths, I would go to China and become a disciple of Confucius.&#8221;
</p><p>In the latter days of Spanish rule Poblete was always more or less under the eyes of the authorities, and on the 17th<corr sic="."/> of April 1896 the Secret Police asked of General Blanco the necessary permission to search the houses of several highly suspicious people, among them that of Pascual H. Poblete.
</p><p>Our hero figured at one time as an expert in the <pb/>raising of subscriptions for monuments and if I am not very much mistaken, he once had a hand in the raising of money for the coming monument to Rizal the hero and martyr of the <hi lang="es" xml:lang="es">Filipino Libre</hi> party. It would be very interesting to know what became of all the funds that passed through his hands: the majority apparently went to back his favorite birds at the cock-pits.
</p><p>Since the American occupation Poblete&#8217;s chief enterprise, apart from cock-fighting and &#8220;sponging upon the <hi lang="es" xml:lang="es">ignorantes</hi> who listened to his ravings with more or less favor because he was a protestant, was the editing and publishing of a dirty little &#8220;sheet&#8221; known as the <hi lang="tl" xml:lang="tl">Ang Kapatid nang Bayan</hi>.&#8221; In this so called newspaper Poblete aired his radical political ideas with such vigor that the Provost Marshal was compelled to call him down. The <hi lang="es" xml:lang="es">pobre diablo</hi> then turned his attention <pb/>to another pastime which would combine the advantages of demonstrating his <corr sic="insurpassable">unsurpassable</corr> abilities, of airing his opinions and, last mentioned but of the greatest importance, the quality of putting into his pocket a goodly number of easily <corr sic="eared">earned</corr> dollars. This pastime took the shape of a theatrical enterprise: Constancia, the daughter of the said mountebank &#8220;composed and wrote&#8221; a play entitled <hi lang="tl" xml:lang="tl">Ang Pag Ibig Sa Lupang Tinubinan</hi>: For the Love of Country. <corr sic="Poblete,s">Poblete&#8217;s</corr> better half (which is not saying much) played the part of the heroine. The whole play was incendiary in the extreme and the audience being <corr sic="tagalogs">Tagalogs</corr> of the lowest and most ignorant class, the result was that they were thrown into a state of the greatest frenzy. Poblete put this play on the boards of the <hi lang="es" xml:lang="es">Teatro Oriental</hi>. All went well in the first acts; and following out the <pb/>&#8220;plot&#8221; of the play, the town of Imus was supposed to have been taken by the rebels. Dramatic shouts of <hi lang="es" xml:lang="es">Viva La Independencia</hi>; were raised from time to time by the actors, followed by shouts from the audience of <hi lang="es" xml:lang="es">Viva Filipinas! Viva Aguinaldo!</hi> Suddenly there rushed from the &#8220;wings&#8221; a gaudy looking creature who ought to have been the Tondo market selling cockles and crabs; this turned out to be the heroine. In one hand she held a revolutionary flag and in the other a <hi>bolo</hi>. <foreign lang="es" xml:lang="es">Viva La Independencia</foreign> was the shout which almost raised the roof; but as fate would have it Poblete was doomed to be humbled to the dust. Just as he was promising himself a fine string of dollars from his new enterprise Capt. Lara and a number of police appeared on the scene, and Poblete, his katipunan banners and bolos etc., were seized and the house <pb/>cleared of its fanatical occupants.
</p><p>To-day he amuses himself in fitting out bands of little boys who on &#8220;state&#8221; occasions parade the streets with American flags and Japanese lanterns, and placards with various inscriptions, the chief ones being petitions for an amnesty on behalf of all those who have &#8220;done what they ought not to have done&#8221;. Poblete would open the doors of the prisons of the Archipelago and let loose all their occupants. The result? A political boom for Poblete, an increase in the membership of the <hi lang="es" xml:lang="es">Partido Nacionalista</hi> and an increase of crime to a thousand fold, not only in Manila but throughout the whole archipelago.
</p><p>Poor Poblete a <hi lang="es" xml:lang="es">pobre infeliz</hi>, a stain upon the good name of the filipino. But then, what would <hi>Filipinas</hi> be without her Poblete; almost like a cat without fleas.</p></note>.


</p><p id="n101"><hi rend="sc">Note 101.</hi> Apolinario Mabini was born in the pueblo of Tanauan, province of Batangas, and was the son of parents of the poorer and lower classes. He came to Manila as a lad and received his <corr sic="secondry">secondary</corr> education in the College of San Juan de Letran at the hands of the Dominican Fathers, taking the degree of professor. Later on he was employed in the <hi lang="es" xml:lang="es">Intendencia</hi> and by <pb id="pb311" n="311"/>careful saving and by steady application he continued his studies for law and concluded his course at the University of Santo Tomas also at the hands of the Dominicans who spared no efforts on behalf of his success. From the University he received the title of <corr sic="Licenciate">Licentiate</corr> of Law in 1895.
</p><p>He entered the office of the notary Numeriano Adriano to practice law, and whilst there employed, was drawn by Adriano into the net of masonry, joining the lodge Balagtas which was one of those founded from the <corr sic="everflow">overflow</corr> of the original <corr sic="filipino">Filipino</corr> lodge <hi>Nilad</hi>. Adriano was the <hi>venerable</hi> of the said <pb id="pb312" n="312"/>lodge. When the <hi>Liga Filipina</hi> was formed and had gotten well into working order Mabini was named a councillor of the superior Council (see page 28). According to the testimony of Moises Salvador (see page 296) Mabini was also secretary of the Association of <hi>Compromisarios</hi>.
</p><p>He was arrested as one of the chief instigators of the revolt and after due trial was sentenced to death. The Spanish authorities however, took compassion upon him because of his pitiful condition, he being paralysed in the lower parts of the body<note n="a">Cruz Herrera, now <hi>alcalde</hi> of Manila, was another upon whom the authorities took pity on account of the rheumatism from which he suffered to such an extent that he could scarcely walk.</note>; so instead of including his name in the list <pb id="pb313" n="313"/>of those who expiated their treason on the field of Bagumbayan, they foolishly gave him his liberty.
</p><p>Once more free, Mabini left Manila for his own <hi>pueblo</hi> of Tanauan where he lived quietly till Aguinaldo was brought over in 1898 by Admiral Dewey to serve as a bush-beater to the American forces. Mabini was thereupon carried from Tanauan to Cavite where he joined the faithless <hi>Magdalo</hi>.
</p><p>In Cavite he drew up a project of a constitutional law for the Philippines. In the first page of this he affirmed that the precepts of the Ten Commandments were <pb id="pb314" n="314"/>an invention of the friars! And yet Mabini was the <corr sic="filipino">Filipino</corr> Solomon. He instructed the people that they ought not to believe in the said decalogue or practice what it commanded, but that they should only practice the precepts of the <hi lang="es" xml:lang="es">Verdadero Dec&#225;logo</hi> which he prepared and gave to the public as their spiritual guide.
</p><p>Mabini very soon became radical and decidedly anti-American in his ideas, and succeeded in attaining such moral <corr sic="ascendency">ascendancy</corr> over Aguinaldo that the latter ceased to be the leader of the people and the true dictator of the <corr sic="filipino">Filipino</corr> republic, becoming <pb id="pb315" n="315"/>a toy in the hands of a man who could twist and turn him here and there at his will.
</p><p>Mabini refused to take the oath of allegiance and was, on the 7th of January 1901 deported under General Order No. 4 to the island of Guam, as one of the persons &#8220;whose acts clearly <corr sic="demostrate">demonstrate</corr> them to be favorers or sympathizers with the insurrection.&#8221;


</p><p id="n102"><hi rend="sc">Note 102.</hi> The advanced political ideas held and propagated by the <corr sic="seperatists">separatists</corr> were not bad in themselves; no particular objection <pb id="pb316" n="316"/>can be raised against them as political ideas. But when we consider by whom and for whom these &#8220;reforms&#8221; were asked, we begin to appreciate the necessity to which the indian was put of endeavoring to attain them by armed struggle. Taking away the revolutionary basis upon which the plans of the <hi>Liga</hi> were raised, nothing remains but the empty walls of a roofless building. These walls or ideas are contained in the plans of reforms drawn up by almost every jackanapes in the <hi>Liga</hi> who could write down his thoughts with any amount of clearness. These plans agreed upon certain <pb id="pb317" n="317"/>points, chiefly representation in the Spanish parliament and the expulsion of the Religious Orders. These two points appear to have been the essence of the direct aims of the <corr sic="seperatists">separatists</corr> (see p. 69<corr sic=".)">).</corr>
</p><p>Others called for the Spanish constitution with its consequences: the liberty of the press and the liberty of associations. Liberty of the press was ever an unknown quantity in the Philippines. The idea of the liberty of the press is very beautiful when its liberties are not abused; it was the abuse of what little liberty the press enjoyed, in the latter days of Spanish rule, that induced the <pb id="pb318" n="318"/>authorities to impose such a close censure upon it as they did. Whatever may be said in its favor, press censorship and such sedition laws as we enjoy to-day in this nondescript piece of the world&#8217;s surface, are more proper of absolute monarchies than of territory of the U. S. of America, although in our particular case we might as well be under the despotic, ever deteriorating rule of Aguinaldo, as that of a body of men whose intentions however good and sincere they may be, fall short, when put into practice, of the proverbial ingenuity in governing, of the famous Sancho Panza in his <hi>island</hi> of Barataria. Freedom of the <pb id="pb319" n="319"/>press is at times a blessing, and at others a curse. From 1888 to 1896 it would have been more of the latter than of the former; for giving such a liberty to the <corr sic="seperatists">separatists</corr> who asked it, would be arming the enemy with the best arms.
</p><p>As to liberty of associations. People in the Temperance world often ask themselves, does prohibition prohibit? Some <hi>make</hi> themselves believe that it does; but practice has shown what common sense tells each and every one of us, that it does not; for if a man (and I do not wish to be so ungallant as to exclude the ladies) cannot get what he wants legally, he as a rule sees that he gets it somehow. And so with the <corr sic="filipinos">Filipinos</corr> who, denied the liberty of association, defied the authorities and held their gatherings in secret and secluded places.
</p><p>All these various political ideas were decidedly <hi>advanced</hi> in as much as they had relation to a people in no way prepared to receive them. No father would put a loaded revolver or an open <corr sic="rasor">razor</corr> into the hands of his child; but those were the very things the <corr sic="seperatists">separatists</corr> were howling for.

</p><p>&#8220;Venerable Masters and beloved brethren. After our circular of the 28th of May last it would seem unnecessary to remind <corr sic="you you">you</corr>, that you give the most exact <corr sic="fulfilment">fulfillment</corr> to those points which the same embraces, the which were approved by the Grand Assembly celebrated on the 15th of the same month; but nevertheless, as the time of our cause has assured and all provision is but little in the present moments, <pb id="pb321" n="321"/>it has appeared well to us to direct this other circular to you in order to fix more correctly the points which have to be the object of the most exact <corr sic="fulfilment">fulfillment</corr>. We will now pass on to the enumeration of the same.
</p><p><hi>First</hi>: The triangles will perform strictly all and every one of the dispositions dictated by their respective presidents, and venerable honorary brethren, not allowing the least or most insignificant point to slip their <corr sic="osbervation">observation</corr>, for even when it seems to our venerable brethren otherwise, it is of the greatest transcendency.
</p><p>&#8220;The smallest omission in these dispositions might prejudice in a great manner our labors, the fruit of many years of constancy and hope of a sure triumph.
</p><p>&#8220;<hi>Second</hi>: Once the signal is given every bro&#8756; shall <corr sic="fulfil">fulfill</corr> the duty imposed upon him by this Gr&#8756; Reg&#8756; Log&#8756; without considerations of any kind, neither of parentage, friendship or gratitude, etc.
</p><p>&#8220;<hi>Third</hi><corr sic=".">:</corr> Those who on <corr sic="acccount">account</corr> of debility, cowardice or other considerations do not <corr sic="fulfil">fulfill</corr> their duty, already know the tremendous punishment they will incur for disloyalty and disobedience to this G. R. Log.
</p><p><hi>Fourth</hi>: The blow having been struck <pb id="pb322" n="322"/>at the Captain General and the other Spanish Authorities, the loyals shall attack the convents and shall behead their infamous inhabitants, respecting the wealth contained in the said convents; this shall be gathered by the commissions named for that purpose by the G. R. Log. and it shall not <corr sic="by">be</corr> lawful for any of our brethren to possess themselves of what justly belongs to the treasury of the G. N. F. (Grand Filipino Nation)
</p><p>&#8220;<hi>Fifth</hi>: <corr sic="those">Those</corr> who fail to carry out what is set forth in the foregoing paragraph shall be held as malefactors and subjected to exemplary punishment by this G. R. Log.
</p><p>&#8220;<hi>Sixth</hi>: <corr sic="on">On</corr> the following day the bro&#8756; designated shall bury all the bodies of their hateful oppressors in the field of Bagumbayan together with their <corr sic="wifes">wives</corr> and children, and on the site shall later on be raised a monument commemorative of the independence of the G. N. F.
</p><p>&#8220;<hi>Seventh</hi>: <corr sic="the">The</corr> bodies of the members of the Religious Orders shall not be buried, but burned in just payment of the felonies which they committed during life against <corr sic="filipino">Filipino</corr> nation during the three hundred years of their nefarious domination. (see note <ref target="n26">26</ref><corr>.</corr>)
<pb id="pb323" n="323"/></p><p>&#8220;And whilst awaiting the day of our redemption this executive commission shall continue giving the sure guide which we all have to follow in the presence of the facts to the end that none of our brethren shall be able to say that they were unwarned.

</p></div1><div1 id="appb" n="B" type="Appendix"><head>Appendix B.</head><p>Under the title of &#8220;My part in the Revolution,&#8221; Isabelo de los Reyes <corr sic="is">in</corr> an artful attempt to defend himself before those who considered him a coward because of his ever shirking that part of the task of the revolt which naturally fell to him, gives his readers the following information:
</p><p>&#8220;When it was desired to effect the <corr sic="manifestacion">manifestation</corr> of 1888, (see p. 60), Ramos took me to the palace of Malaca&#241;an, to express to Gen. Terrero verbally the complaints of <pb id="pb324" n="324"/>the &#8220;country&#8221;; but I do not know why, but on that day the <corr sic="manifestacion">manifestation</corr> did not come off....&#8221;
</p><p>&#8220;From the palace of Malaca&#241;an we went to the house of Doroteo Cortes, who instructed me in the object of the manifestation, thus:
</p><p>&#8220;... We reckon with the pleasure of the Civil Governor Sr. Centeno (see note 2) to make a manifestation against the friars, who oppress us with their abuses, and oppose the progress of the country.&#8221;
</p><p>&#8220;&#8212;Very good indeed I replied full of enthusiasm.
</p><p>&#8220;But my enthusiasm disappeared entirely when Cortes told me with the greatest frankness, that they asked and were sure of attaining their wish, that the Archbishop should be deported, merely for having failed to assist at the religious functions dedicated to the King<note n="a"><p>This was Alfonso XII. the anniversary of whose death fell of the 25th of November. <corr sic="Arcbishop">Archbishop</corr> Payo had been suffering for a considerable time from <corr sic="dysentry">dysentery</corr>. Apart from this, the bitterness of the official relations at that time between the civil and ecclesiastical authorities had completely incapacitated the venerable prelate from attending to his official duties. Consequently, acting upon the advice of his physician, the Archbishop left Manila for Navotas for a <pb/>few days of complete rest. The departure of the Archbishop happened to almost coincide with the anniversary of the death of the King; but as the prelate was physically unable to attend to the pontifical ceremonies which were to be held on that day and to the other functions consequent upon such a solemn occasion, he was wisely advised to absent himself from the city.
</p><p>Freemasonry ever on the watch, saw in this an opportunity to attack the Religious Orders, and taking advantage of it, demanded: &#8220;The insult committed by the archbishop being therefore very culpable, and having caused the greatest indignation to the government, to the nation, and in particular to those of this country, as devoted to their king; it is <corr sic="indespensible">indispensable</corr> to <corr sic="expell">expel</corr> him from this soil, imposing upon him the penalty of temporary banishment marked out by article 142 of the penal code.</p></note>.
<pb id="pb325" n="325"/></p><p>&#8220;I then doubted the ability<note n="a">To judge from his writing, Isabelo held the idea that he alone was able to direct everything connected with the revolt. Isabelo takes upon himself the intellectual work of the affair leaving to others the dirty work.</note> of the directors of the manifestation, and believed that they would be <corr sic="irremissably">irremissibly</corr> crushed by the friars, who were very astute and powerful, as in fact it so happened.
</p><p>&#8220;I retired leaving Ramos in that house.
</p><p>&#8220;I immediately went to see his father and said to him: The manifestation has fallen flat. I have come to tell you that in my <pb id="pb326" n="326"/>opinion, your son ought not to sign the instance of the <corr sic="manifestors">manifestos</corr>. Let all those who like do so, but it would be a pity that your son who, in the time to come, may be able to render signal services to the country should now fall crushed by the friars. Now that Cort&#233;s says that he reckons with the authorities, your son&#8217;s signature is not very necessary.
</p><p>&#8220;And neither Cort&#233;s nor Ramos signed it.&#8221;

</p><p>&#8220;Seeing that there have circulated rumors among us that in spite of the masonic secret, in spite of the secrecy of our works, there exist in the hands of our enemies, <pb id="pb327" n="327"/>lists of masons more or less correct, more or less extensive, public opinion has shown itself anxious to know whether we have been vilely sold.... And when the <hi lang="es" xml:lang="es">La Pol&#237;tica de Espa&#241;a en Filipinas</hi> has commenced to publish correspondence which ought to have been carefully and sacredly guarded, this anxiety reached its highest point, embracing the desire to discover the author or authors although it would appear that the source of leakage has been found, even though the form and details are unknown.
</p><p>&#8220;The presidency of the Cons&#8756; Reg&#8756; has not been able to remain indifferent before the scandal which is developing...; on the contrary it has from the first endeavored to discover the truth....
<milestone rend="dots" unit="tb"/>
</p><p>&#8220;I am sorry to have to confess that the hour of the revelation has not yet sounded.... But incidental discoveries oblige me to break silence giving the voice of alarm; and to what point this determination is justified, you shall judge by the facts I am about to relate.
</p><p>&#8220;1st. Pedro Serrano, symbolic name <hi>Panday Pira</hi>, gr&#8756; 24, in his anxiety to <corr sic="descredit">discredit</corr> <pb id="pb328" n="328"/>local masonry, since this refuses to be exploited has permitted himself to make calumnious affirmations to a foreign mason concerning this Federation, manifesting at the same time <corr sic="pretentions">pretensions</corr> which are a sure sign of perverse intentions.
</p><p>&#8220;2nd. It is known that the same Serrano frequents the Archbishop&#8217;s palace and the College of San Juan de Letran with the peculiarity that in both establishments his <corr sic="symbolical">symbolic</corr> name in known, and he has manifested in the formed establishment that he is a man whose companionship is to be avoided because he occupies himself with giving <corr sic="imformation">information</corr>.
</p><p>&#8220;3rd. It happened later on that the said Serrano presented himself in the house of Sr. Marte, gr&#8756; 3, late <corr sic="secretery">secretary</corr> of the lodge <hi>Nilad</hi>, demanding the handing over of documents of the secretaryship which he said belonged to him, threatening that otherwise he would report the matter to General Blanco, and the extraction of the documents would be made by the friar parish priest of the said suburb.
</p><p>&#8220;4th. Lastly: in the meeting of the parochial clergy held in the Archbishop&#8217;s palace&#8212;the morning of the 13th of this <pb id="pb329" n="329"/>month&#8212; ... masonry and masons were discussed; and the Archbishop said to the parish priest of Quiapo: <hi>you must tell the school-master of your suburb that it is not sufficient to have abjured his masonic beliefs, but that it is also necessary to <corr sic="fulfil">fulfill</corr> the conditions agreed upon</hi>.
</p><p>&#8220;Consequently it will be convenient that you gather together the <hi>Cam&#8756; del Medio</hi> and read therein the present document, adding the explanation and comments you deem necessary, and that with respect to the other <hi>CCam&#8756;</hi> you limit yourselves to giving account of the fact, demonstrating its enormity, pointing out its author and taking what steps are necessary to <corr sic="pervent">prevent</corr> contagion.

<pb id="pb330" n="330"/></p></div1><div1 id="appd" n="D" type="Appendix"><head>Appendix D.</head><p><hi>Anting-antings</hi> constitute the remnants of what was once, what might be called the religion of the peoples of the Philippines. They are most commonly met with in the form of amulets which their possessors carry about with them to ward off dangers of all kinds. There are amulets for protection against fire arms, against sword thrust or <hi>bolo</hi> slash; against diseases of all parts of the body; amulets against the bursting of fire arms or to prevent them making a noise when discharged by the wearer of the amulet; against snakes and their bites, against <corr sic="lighting">lightning</corr>; amulets to <corr sic="."/>protect their wearers against the courts of justice and against the authorities when they <corr sic="persue">pursue</corr> them for robbery. In a word amulets or <hi>anting-anting</hi> against everything.
</p><p>As a rules these amulets consist of small booklets containing prayers composed of Latin and Spanish words mixed with words <pb id="pb331" n="331"/>and <corr sic="abreviations">abbreviations</corr> of the native dialects. Some times they are stones or mineral deposits found in the bodies of animals, or the seed portion of petrified fruits, or even parts of the skeletons of children.
</p><p>Although one would suppose that such superstitions had long since ceased to exist among the indians of the archipelago such is not the case; and it is more than probable that the majority of the members of the federal party and may be two out of the three native members of the Commission carry their anting-anting carefully guarded in one of their pockets. However their use is most common among native doctors, that is those who have not studied <corr sic="medecine">medicine</corr>, but who dabble in the art for what they can get out of it, and by <hi lang="es" xml:lang="es">tulisanes</hi> or armed robbers.

</p><p><hi>Anting-anting</hi> is also found in other forms, sometimes merely a strip of paper bearing some inscription, and which receives its virtue from some action performed over it, such as the saying of the mass whilst the paper is on the altar.
</p><p>A parish priest of a pueblo in a neighboring province once related to me the discovery of one such an <hi>anting-anting</hi> in his church. He approached the altar to recite the Mass, and upon genuflecting at the centre of the altar <corr sic="notice">noticed</corr> that there was something unusual, although small, under the altar cloth. He put his hand under the cloth <pb id="pb333" n="333"/>to see what it was and found there a slip of paper bearing three crosses, thus:

</p><p>This paper had been carelessly folded and placed where he found it, upon the altar stone. Had it remained undisturbed and the service of Mass been said over it, it would have, in the belief of the indian who put it there, become infused with <corr sic="marvellous">marvelous</corr> virtues and could have protected its wearer from the dangers to be incurred in the armed rising against the Spaniards which they were about to attempt.
</p><p>In all probability Buencamino carried some <hi>anting-anting</hi> with him to Washington to protect him from <corr sic="assasissination">assassination</corr> or from ... nausea.

</p><p>&#8220;I Faustino Villaruel y Zapanta, 52 years of age, publicly declare that as I was born so wish I to die&#8212;a Spaniard, a christian, a Roman Apostolic Catholic; and that I detest with my whole soul any rebellion or treason against our beloved mother Spain.
</p><p>&#8220;I also repent of having belonged to masonry and of having devoted myself to its propaganda in these islands and having been such a <corr sic="bigotted">bigoted</corr> mason that I caused my two children to enter also into the society I now curse. I <corr sic="council">counsel</corr> my children and all my friends to renounce the said society, and beg pardon of God, as I do now, it being condemned by the Church.
</p><p>&#8220;I beseech the most Excellent and Illustrious Archbishop to make public this my spontaneous and free retraction.&#8212;<hi>Faustino Villaruel</hi>. Witnesses:&#8212;the official guard of the Chapel, <hi>Antonio Pardo</hi>.&#8212;the sergeant of the Guard, <hi>Felix Garcia</hi>.&#8221;
